1 And it was don, in the thrittithe yeer, in the fourthe monethe, in the fyuethe dai of the moneth, whanne Y was in the myddis of caitifs, bisidis the flood Chobar, heuenes weren openyd, and Y siy the reuelaciouns of God.
2 In the fyueth dai of the monethe; thilke is the fyuethe yeer of passing ouer of Joachym, kyng of Juda;
3 the word of the Lord was maad to Ezechiel, preest, the sone of Busi, in the lond of Caldeis, bisidis the flood Chobar; and the hond of the Lord was maad there on hym.
4 And Y siy, and lo! a whirlewynd cam fro the north, and a greet cloude, and fier wlappynge in, and briytnesse in the cumpas therof; and as the licnesse of electre fro the myddis therof, that is, fro the myddis of the fier.
5 And of myddis therof was a licnesse of foure beestis. And this was the biholdyng of tho, the licnesse of a man in tho.
6 And foure faces weren to oon, and foure wyngis weren to oon.
7 And the feet of tho weren streiyt feet, and the soole of the foote of tho was as the soole of a foot of a calf, and sparclis, as the biholdynge of buylynge bras.
8 And the hondis of a man weren vndur the wyngis of tho, in foure partis. And tho hadden faces and wyngis bi foure partis;
9 and the wyngis of tho weren ioyned togidir of oon to another. Tho turneden not ayen, whanne tho yeden, but eche yede bifore his face.
10 Forsothe the licnesse `of the face of tho was the face of a man and the face of a lioun at the riythalf of tho foure. Forsothe the face of an oxe was at the left half of tho foure; and the face of an egle was aboue tho foure.
11 And the faces of tho and the wengis of tho weren stretchid forth aboue. Twei wyngis of eche weren ioyned togidere, and tweyne hiliden the bodies of tho.
12 And ech of tho yede bifore his face. Where the fersnesse of the wynd was, thidur tho yeden, and turneden not ayen, whanne tho yeden.
13 And the licnesse of the beestis, and the biholdyng of tho, was as of brennynge coolis of fier, and as the biholdyng of laumpis. This was the siyt rennynge aboute in the myddis of beestis, the schynyng of fier, and leit goynge out of the fier.
14 And the beestis yeden, and turneden ayen at the licnesse of leit schynynge.
15 And whanne Y bihelde the beestis, o wheel, hauuynge foure faces, apperide on the erthe, bisidis the beestis.
16 And the biholdyng of the wheelis and the werk of tho was as the siyt of the see; and o licnesse was of tho foure; and the biholdyng and the werkis of tho, as if a wheel be in the myddis of a wheel.
17 Tho goynge yeden bi foure partis of tho, and turneden not ayen, whanne tho yeden.
18 Also stature, and hiynesse, and orible biholdyng was to the wheelis; and al the bodi was ful of iyen in the cumpas of tho foure.
19 And whanne the beestis yeden, the wheelis also yeden togidere bisidis tho. And whanne the beestis weren reisid fro the erthe, the wheelis also weren reisid togidere.
20 Whidur euere the spirit yede, whanne the spirit yede thedur, also the wheelis suynge it weren reisid togidere; for whi the spirit of lijf was in the wheelis.
21 Tho yeden with the beestis goynge, and tho stoden with the beestis stondynge. And with the beestis reisid fro erthe, also the wheelis suynge tho beestis weren reisid togidere; for the spirit of lijf was in the wheelis.
22 And the licnesse of the firmament was aboue the heed of the beestis, and as the biholdyng of orible cristal, and stretchid abrood on the heed of tho beestis aboue.
23 Forsothe vndur the firmament the wyngis of tho beestis weren streiyt, of oon to anothir; ech beeste hilide his bodi with twei wyngis, and an other was hilid in lijk maner.
24 And Y herde the sown of wyngis, as the sown of many watris, as the sown of hiy God. Whanne tho yeden, ther was as a sown of multitude, as the sown of oostis of batel; and whanne tho stoden, the wyngis of tho weren late doun.
25 For whi whanne a vois was maad on the firmament, that was on the heed of tho, tho stoden, and leten doun her wyngis.
26 And on the firmament, that was aboue the heed of tho, was as the biholdyng of a saphire stoon, the licnesse of a trone; and on the licnesse of the trone was a licnesse, as the biholdyng of a man aboue.
27 And Y siy as a licnesse of electre, as the biholding of fier with ynne, bi the cumpas therof; fro the lendis of hym and aboue, and fro the lendis of him til to bynethe, Y siy as the licnesse of fier schynynge in cumpas,
28 as the biholdynge of the reynbowe, whanne it is in the cloude in the dai of reyn. This was the biholdyng of schynyng bi cumpas.

CAP 2
1 This was a siyt of the licnesse of the glorie of the Lord. And Y siy, and felle doun on my face; and Y herde the vois of a spekere. And he seide to me, Thou, sone of man, stonde on thi feet, and Y schal speke with thee.
2 And the spirit entride in to me, after that he spak to me, and settide me on my feet. And Y herde oon spekynge to me,
3 and seiynge, Sone of man, Y sende thee to the sones of Israel, to folkis apostatas, `ether goynge a bak fro feith, that yeden awei fro me; the fadris of hem braken my couenaunt til to this dai.
4 And the sones ben of hard face, and of vnchastisable herte, to whiche Y sende thee. And thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis;
5 if perauenture nameli thei heren, and if perauenture thei resten, for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe. And thei schulen wite, that a profete is in the myddis of hem.
6 Therfore thou, sone of man, drede not hem, nether drede thou the wordis of hem; for vnbileueful men and distrieris ben with thee, and thou dwellist with scorpiouns. Drede thou not the wordis of hem, and drede thou not the faces of hem, for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.
7 Therfor thou schalt speke my wordis to hem, if perauenture thei heren, and resten, for thei ben terreris to wraththe.
8 But thou, sone of man, here what euer thingis Y schal speke to thee; and nyle thou be a terrere to wraththe, as the hows of Israel is a terrere to wraththe. Opene thi mouth, and ete what euer thingis Y yyue to thee.
9 And Y siy, and lo! an hond was sent to me, in which a book was foldid togidere. And he spredde abrood it bifor me, that was writun with ynne and with outforth. And lamentaciouns, and song, and wo, weren writun ther ynne.

CAP 3
1 And he seide to me, Sone of man, ete thou what euer thing thou fyndist, ete thou this volym; and go thou, and speke to the sones of Israel.
2 And Y openyde my mouth, and he fedde me with that volym.
3 And he seide to me, Sone of man, thi wombe schal ete, and thin entrails schulen be fillid with this volym, which Y yyue to thee. And Y eet it, and it was maad as swete hony in my mouth.
4 And he seide to me, Sone of man, go thou to the hous of Israel, and thou schalt speke my wordis to hem.
5 For thou schalt not be sent to a puple of hiy word, and of vnknowun langage; thou schalt be sent to the hous of Israel,
6 nether to many puplis of hiy word, and of vnknowun langage, of whiche thou maist not here the wordis. And if thou were sent to hem, thei schulden here thee.
7 But the hous of Israel nylen here thee, for thei nylen here me. For al the hous of Israel is of vnschamefast forheed, and of hard herte.
8 Lo! Y yaf thi face strongere than the faces of hem, and thi forheed hardere than the forheedis of hem.
9 Y yaf thi face as an adamaunt, and as a flynt; drede thou not hem, nether drede thou of the face of hem, for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.
10 And he seide to me, Sone of man, take in thin herte, and here with thin eeris alle these my wordis, whiche Y speke to thee.
11 And go thou, and entre to the passyng ouer, to the sones of thi puple. And thou schalt speke to hem, and thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, if perauenture thei heren, and resten.
12 And the spirit took me, and Y herde after me the vois of a greet mouyng. The blessid glorie of the Lord was herd fro his place;
13 and Y herde the vois of wyngis of the beestis smytynge oon an othir, and the vois of wheelis suynge the beestis, and the vois of greet stiryng.
14 Also the spirit reiside me, and took me. And Y yede forth bittir in the indignacioun of my spirit; for the hond of the Lord was with me, and coumfortide me.
15 And Y cam to the passyng ouer, to the heep of newe fruytis, to hem that dwelliden bisidis the flood Chobar. And Y sat where thei saten, and Y dwellide there seuene daies, weilynge, in the myddis of hem.
16 Forsothe whanne seuene daies weren passid, the word of the Lord was maad to me, and seide, Sone of man,
17 Y yaf thee `a spiere to the hous of Israel. And thou schalt here of my mouth a word, and thou schalt telle to hem of me.
18 If whanne Y seie to the wickid man, Thou schalt die bi deth, thou tellist not to hym, and spekist not to hym, that he be turned fro his wickid weie, and lyue; thilke wickid man schal die in his wickidnesse, but Y schal seke his blood of thin hond.
19 Forsothe if thou tellist to the wickid man, and he is not conuertid fro his wickidnesse, and fro his wickid weie; sotheli he schal die in his wickidnesse, but thou hast delyuerid thi soule.
20 But also if a iust man is turned fro his riytfulnesse, and doith wickidnesse, Y schal sette an hirtyng bifor hym; he schal die, for thou teldist not to hym; he schal die in his synne, and hise riytfulnessis, whiche he dide, schulen not be in mynde, but Y schal seke his blood of thin hond.
21 Forsothe if thou tellist to a iust man, that a iust man do not synne, and he doith not synne, he lyuynge schal lyue, for thou teldist to hym, and thou hast delyuered thi soule.
22 And the hond of the Lord was maad on me, and he seide to me, Rise thou, and go out in to the feeld, and there Y schal speke with thee.
23 And Y roos, and yede out in to the feeld. And lo! the glorie of the Lord stood there, as the glorie which Y siy bisidis the flood Chobar; and Y felle doun on my face.
24 And the spirit entride in to me, and settide me on my feet. And he spak to me, and seide to me, Entre thou, and be thou closid in the myddis of thin hous.
25 And thou, sone of man, lo! boondis ben youun on thee, and thei schulen bynde thee with tho, and thou schalt not go out in the myddis of hem.
26 And Y schal make thi tunge to cleue to the roof of thi mouth, and thou schalt be doumbe, and thou schalt not be as a man rebuykinge; for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.
27 But whanne Y schal speke to thee, Y schal opene thi mouth, and thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, He that herith, here, and he that restith, reste; for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.

CAP 4
1 And thou, sone of man, take to thee a tijl stoon; and thou schalt sette it bifore thee, and thou schalt discriue ther ynne the citee of Jerusalem.
2 And thou schalt ordeyne bisegyng ayenus that Jerusalem; and thou schalt bilde strengthis, and thou schalt bere togidere erthe, and thou shalt yyue oostis of batel ayens it, and thou schalt sette engynes in cumpas.
3 And take thou to thee an irone friynge panne; and thou schalt sette it in to an irone wal bitwixe thee and bitwixe the cite; and thou schalt sette stidfastli thi face to it, and it schal be in to bisegyng, and thou schalt cumpasse it; it is a signe to the hous of Israel.
4 And thou schalt slepe on thi left side, and thou schalt putte the wickidnessis of the hous of Israel on that side, in the noumbre of daies in which thou shalt slepe on that side, and thou schalt take the wickidnesse of hem.
5 Forsothe Y yaf to thee the yeeris of the wickidnesse of hem bi noumbre of daies, thre hundrid and nynti daies; and thou schalt bere the wickidnesse of the hous of Israel.
6 And whanne thou hast fillid these thingis, thou schalt slepe the secounde tyme on thi riytside. And thou schalt take the wickidnesse of the hous of Juda bi fourti daies; Y yaf to thee a dai for a yeer, a dai sotheli for a yeer.
7 And thou schalt turne thi face to the biseging of Jerusalem; and thin arm schal be stretchid forth, and thou schalt profesie ayens it.
8 Lo! Y haue cumpassid thee with boondis, and thou schalt not turne thee fro thi side in `to other side, tille thou fille the daies of thi bisegyng.
9 And take thou to thee wheete, and barli, and beenys, and tillis, and mylie, and vetchis; and thou schalt putte tho in to o vesselle. And thou schalt make to thee looues for the noumbre of daies, bi whiche thou schalt slepe on thi side; bi three hundrid and nynti daies thou schalt ete it.
10 Forsothe thi mete, which thou schalt ete, schal be in weiyte twenti staters in a dai; fro tyme til to tyme thou schalt ete it.
11 And thou schalt drynke watir in mesure, the sixte part of hyn; fro tyme til to tyme thou schalt drynke it.
12 And thou schalt ete it as barli breed bakun vndur the aischis; and with `a toord that goith out of a man thou schalt hile, it bifore the iyen of hem.
13 The Lord seith these thingis, So the sones of Israel schulen ete her breed defoulid among hethene men, to whiche Y schal caste hem out.
14 And Y seide, A! A! A! Lord God, lo! my soule is not defoulid, and fro my yong childhed til to now Y eet not a thing deed bi it silf, and to-rent of beestis; and al vnclene fleisch entride not in to my mouth.
15 And he seide to me, Lo! Y haue youe to thee the dung of oxis for mennus toordis; and thou schalt make thi breed with it.
16 And he seide to me, Sone of man, lo! Y schal al to-breke the staf of breed in Jerusalem, and thei schulen ete her breed in weiyte and in bisynesse, and thei schulen drynke water in mesure and in angwisch;
17 that whanne breed and watir failen, eche man falle doun to his brother, and thei faile in her wickidnessis.

CAP 5
1 And thou, sone of man, take to thee a scharp swerd, schauynge heeris; and thou schalt take it, and schalt leede it bi thin heed, and bi thi berd. And thou schalt take to thee a balaunce of weiyte, and thou schalt departe tho.
2 Thou schalt brenne the thridde part with fier in the myddis of the citee, bi the fillyng of daies of bisegyng. And thou schalt take the thridde part, and schalt kitte bi swerd in the cumpas therof. But thou schalt scatere `the tother thridde part in to the wynd; and Y schal make nakid a swerd aftir hem.
3 And thou schalt take therof a litil noumbre, and thou schalt bynde tho in the hiynesse of thi mentil.
4 And eft thou schalt take of hem, and thou schalt caste forth hem in to the myddis of the fier. And thou schalt brenne hem in fier; and fier schal go out of that in to al the hous of Israel.
5 The Lord God seith these thingis, This is Jerusalem; Y haue sette it in the myddis of hethene men, and londis in the cumpas therof.
6 And it dispiside my domes, that it was more wickid than hethene men; and it dispiside my comaundementis more than londis that ben in the cumpas therof. For thei han cast awei my domes, and thei yeden not in my comaundementis.
7 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, For ye `han passid hethene men that ben in youre cumpas, and ye yeden not in my comaundementis, and ye diden not my domes, and ye wrouyten not bi the domes of hethene men that ben in youre cumpas;
8 therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y to thee, and Y my silf schal make domes in the myddis of thee, bifor the iyen of hethene men; and Y schal do thingis in thee,

10 Therfor fadris schulen ete sones in the myddis of thee, and sones schulen ete her fadris; and Y schal make domes in thee, and Y schal wyndewe alle thin remenauntis in to ech wynd.
11 Therfor Y lyue, seith the Lord God, no but for that that thou defoulidist myn hooli thing in alle thin offenciouns, and in alle thin abhomynaciouns; and Y schal breke, and myn iye schal not spare, and Y schal not do merci.
12 The thridde part of thee schal die bi pestilence, and schal be wastid bi hungur in the middis of thee; and the thridde part of thee schal falle doun bi swerd in thi cumpas; forsothe Y schal scatere thi thridde part in to ech wynd, and Y schal drawe out a swerd after hem.
13 And Y schal fille my stronge veniaunce, and Y schal make myn indignacioun to reste in hem, and Y schal be coumfortid. And thei schulen wite, that Y the Lord spak in my feruent loue, whanne Y schal fille al myn indignacioun in hem.
14 And Y schal yyue thee in to desert, in to schenschipe to hethene men that ben in thi cumpas, in the siyt of ech that passith forth.
15 And thou schalt be schenschipe `and blasfemye, ensaumple and wondryng, among hethene men that ben in thi cumpas, whanne Y schal make domes in thee, in strong veniaunce, and indignacioun, and in blamyngis of ire.
16 Y the Lord haue spoke, whanne Y schal sende in to hem the worste arowis of hungur, that schulen bere deth; and whiche Y schal sende, that Y leese you. And Y schal gadere hungur on you, and Y schal al to-breke in you the sadnesse of breed.
17 And Y schal sende in to you hungur, and worste beestis, til to the deth; and pestilence and blood schulen passe bi thee, and Y schal bringe in swerd on thee; Y the Lord spak.

CAP 6
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,

3 Hillis of Israel, here ye the word of the Lord God. The Lord God seith these thingis to mounteyns, and litil hillis, to roochis of stoon, and to valeis, Lo! Y schal bringe in on you a swerd, and Y schal leese youre hiye thingis.
4 And Y schal distrie youre auteris, and youre symylacris schulen be brokun; and Y schal caste doun youre slayn men bifore youre idols.
5 dnA Y schal yyue the deed bodies of the sones of Israel bifor the face of youre symylacris, and Y schal scatere youre boonys
6 aboute youre auteris, in alle youre dwellingis. Citees schulen be forsakun, and hiy thingis schulen be distried, and schulen be scaterid; and youre auteris schulen perische, and schulen be brokun. And youre idols schulen ceesse, and youre templis of idols schulen be al to-brokun, and youre werkis schulen be doen awei.
7 And a slayn man schal falle doun in the myddis of you; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
8 And Y schal leeue in you hem that fledden swerd among hethene men, whanne Y schal scatere you in to londis.
9 And youre delyuered men schulen haue mynde on me among hethene men, to whiche thei ben led prisoneris; for Y haue al to-broke her herte doynge fornycacioun, and goynge awei fro me, and her iyen doynge fornicacioun aftir her idols. And thei schulen displese hem silf on the yuels, whiche thei diden in alle her abhomynaciouns.
10 And thei schulen wite, that Y the Lord spak not in veyn, that Y schulde do this yuel to hem.
11 The Lord God seith these thingis, Smyte thin hond, and hurtle thi foot, and seie, Alas! to alle abhomynaciouns of the yuelis of the hous of Israel; for thei schulen falle doun bi swerd, hungur, and pestilence. He that is fer, shal die bi pestilence.
12 Forsothe he that is niy, shal falle bi swerd. And he that is laft and bisegid, shal die bi hungur. And Y schal fille myn indignacioun in hem.
13 And ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, whanne youre slayn men schulen be in the myddis of youre idols, in the cumpas of youre auteris, in eche hiy litil hil, and in alle the hiynessis of mounteyns, and vndur ech tree ful of wode, and vndur ech ook ful of boowis, that is, a place where thei brenten encense swete smellynge to alle her idols.
14 And Y schal stretche forth myn hond on hem, and Y schal make her lond desolat and destitute, fro desert Deblata, in alle the dwellyngis of hem; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.

CAP 7
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
2 `and he seide, And thou, sone of man, the Lord God of the lond of Israel seith these thingis, The ende cometh, the ende cometh, on foure coostis of the lond.
3 Now an ende is on thee, and Y shal sende in my strong veniaunce on thee, and Y schal deme thee bi thi weies, and Y schal sette alle thin abhomynaciouns ayens thee.
4 And myn iye shal not spare on thee, and Y schal not do mercy. But Y shal sette thi weies on thee, and thin abhomynaciouns schulen be in the myddis of thee; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
5 The Lord God seith these thingis, O turment, lo!
6 turment cometh; the ende cometh, the ende cometh; it schal wake fulli ayens thee; lo! it cometh.
7 Sorewe cometh on thee, that dwellist in the lond; the tyme cometh, the dai of sleyng is niy, and not of glorie of hillis.
8 Now anoon Y schal schede out myn ire on thee, and Y schal fille my strong veniaunce in thee; and Y schal deme thee bi thi weies, and Y schal putte to thee alle thi grete trespassis.
9 And myn iye schal not spare, nether Y schal do merci; but Y schal putte on thee thi weies, and thin abhomynaciouns schulen be in the myddis of thee; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord smytynge.
10 Lo! the dai, lo! it cometh; sorewe is gon out. A yerde flouride,
11 pride buriownede, wickidnesse roos in the yerde of vnpitee; not of hem, and not of the puple, nether of the sown of hem, and no reste shal be in hem.
12 The tyme cometh, the dai neiyede; he that bieth, be not glad, and he that sillith, mourne not; for whi ire is on al the puple therof.
13 For he that sillith, schal not turne ayen to that that he seelde, and yit the lijf of hem is in lyueris; for whi the reuelacioun to al the multitude therof shal not go ayen, and a man schal not be coumfortid in the wickidnesse of his lijf.
14 Synge ye with a trumpe, alle men be maad redi, and noon is that schal go to batel; for whi my wraththe is on al the puple therof.
15 Swerd is with out forth, pestilence and hungur with ynne; he that is in the feeld, schal die bi swerd; and thei that ben in the citee, schulen be deuourid bi pestilence and hungur.
16 And thei schulen be sauyd that fleen of hem; and thei schulen be as culueris of grete valeis in hillis, alle quakynge, ech man in his wickidnesse.
17 Alle hondis schulen be aclumsid, and alle knees schulen flowe with watris.
18 And thei schulen girde hem with heiris, and inward drede schal hile hem; and schenschipe schal be in ech face, and ballidnesse schal be in alle the heedis of hem.
19 The siluer of hem schal be cast out, and the gold of hem schal be in to a dunghil; the siluer of hem and the gold of hem schal not mowe delyuere hem in the dai of the strong veniaunce of the Lord. Thei schulen not fille her soule, and the wombis of hem schulen not be fillid; for it is maad the sclaundre of hir wickidnesse.
20 And thei setteden the ournement of her brochis in to pride; and thei maden of it the ymagis of her abhomynaciouns and simylacris. For this thing Y yaf it to hem, in to vnclennesse.
21 And Y schal yyue it in to the hondis of aliens, to rauysche, and to the vnpitouse men of erthe, in to prey, and thei schulen defoule it.
22 And Y schal turne awei my face fro hem, and thei schulen defoule my priuyte; and harlotis schulen entre in to it, and schulen defoule it.
23 Make thou a closyng to gidere; for the lond is ful of doom of bloodis, and the citee is ful of wickidnesse.
24 And Y schal brynge the worste of hethene men, and thei schulen haue in possessioun the housis of hem; and Y schal make the pride of miyti men to ceesse, and enemyes schulen haue in possessioun the seyntuaries of hem.
25 In anguysch comynge aboue thei schulen seke pees, and it schal not be.
26 Disturblyng schal come on disturblyng, and heryng on heryng; and thei schulen seke of the profete a reuelacioun, and lawe shal perische fro the preest, and counsel fro eldre men.
27 The kyng schal mourne, and the prince schal be clothid in weilyng, and the hondis of the puple of the lond schulen be disturblid; bi the weie of hem Y schal do to hem, and bi the domes of hem Y schal deme hem; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.

1 And it was doon in the sixte yeer, in the sixte monethe, in the fyuethe dai of the monethe, Y sat in myn hous, and the elde men of Juda saten bifore me; and the hond of the Lord God felle there on me.
2 And Y siy, and lo! a licnesse as the biholdyng of fier; fro the biholding of hise leendis and bynethe was fier, and fro hise leendis and aboue was as the biholdyng of schynyng, as the siyt of electre.
3 And the licnesse of an hond was sent out, and took me bi the heer of myn heed; and the spirit reiside me bitwixe heuene and erthe, and brouyte me in to Jerusalem, in the siyt of God, bisidis the ynnere dore that bihelde to the north, where the idol of enuye was set, to stire indignacioun.
4 And lo! the glorie of God of Israel was there, bi siyt which Y siy in the feeld.
5 And he seide to me, Thou, sone of man, reise thin iyen to the weie of the north; and Y reiside myn iyen to the weie of the north, and lo! fro the north of the yate of the auter the idol of enuye was in that entryng.
6 And he seide to me, Sone of man, gessist thou whether thou seest what thing these men doon, the grete abhomynaciouns whiche the hous of Israel doith here, that Y go fer awei fro my seyntuarie? and yit thou schalt turne, and schalt se grettere abhomynaciouns.
7 And he ledde me with ynne to the dore of the halle; and Y siy, and lo! oon hoole in the wal.

10 And Y entride, and siy; and lo! ech licnesse of `crepynge beestis, and abhomynacioun of beestis, and alle idols of the hous of Israel, weren peyntid in the wal al aboute in cumpas.
11 And seuenti men of the eldere of the hous of Israel stoden; and Jeconye, the sone of Saphan, stood in the myddis of hem, stondynge bifore the peyntyngis; and ech man hadde a censere in his hond, and the smoke of a cloude of encense stiede.
12 And he seide to me, Certis, sone of man, thou seest what thingis the eldere men of the hous of Israel doen in derknessis, ech man in the hid place of his bed; for thei seiyn, The Lord seeth not vs, the Lord hath forsake the lond.
13 And the Lord seide to me, Yit thou schalt turne, and schalt se gretter abhomynaciouns, whiche these men doon.
14 And he ledde me with ynne, bi the dore of the yate of the hous of the Lord, which dore bihelde to the north; and lo! wymmen saten there, biweilynge Adonydes.

17 And the Lord seide to me, Certis, sone of man, thou hast seyn; whether this is a liyt thing to the hous of Juda, that thei schulden do these abhomynaciouns, whiche thei diden here? For thei filliden the lond with wickidnesse, and turneden to terre me to wraththe; and lo! thei applien a braunche to her nose thirlis.
18 Therfor and Y schal do in strong veniaunce; myn iye schal not spare, nether Y schal do merci; and whanne thei schulen crie to myn eris with greet vois, Y schal not here hem.

1 And he criede in myn eeris with greet vois, and seide, The visityngis of the citee han neiyed, and ech man hath in his hond an instrument of sleyng.
2 And lo! sixe men camen fro the weie of the hiyere yate, that biholdith to the north, and the instrument of deth of ech man was in his hond; also o man in the myddis of hem was clothid with lynnun clothis, and a pennere of a writere at hise reynes; and thei entriden, and stoden bisidis the brasun auter.
3 And the glorie of the Lord of Israel was takun vp fro cherub, which glorie was on it, to the threisfold of the hous; and the Lord clepide the man that was clothid with lynun clothis, and hadde a pennere of a writere in hise leendis.
4 And the Lord seide to hym, Passe thou bi the myddis of the citee, in the myddis of Jerusalem, and marke thou Thau on the forhedis of men weilynge and sorewynge on alle abhomynaciouns that ben doon in the myddis therof.
5 And he seide to hem in myn heryng, Go ye thorouy the citee, and sue ye hym, and smytte ye; youre iye spare not, nether do ye merci.
6 Sle ye til to deth, an eld man, a yong man, and a virgyn, a litil child, and wymmen; but sle ye not ony man, on whom ye seen Thau; and bigynne ye at my seyntuarie. Therfore thei bigunnen at the eldere men, that weren bifore the face of the hous.
7 And he seide to hem, Defoule ye the hous, and fille ye the hallis with slayn men; go ye out. And thei yeden out, and killiden hem that weren in the citee.
8 And lo! whanne the sleyng was fillid, Y was left. And Y felle doun on my face, and Y criede, and seide, Alas! alas! alas! Lord God, therfor whether thou schalt leese alle remenauntis of Israel, and schalt schede out thi stronge veniaunce on Jerusalem?
9 And he seide to me, The wickidnesse of the hous of Israel and of Juda is ful greet, and the lond is fillid of bloodis, and the citee is fillid with turnyng awei; for thei seiden, The Lord hath forsake the lond, and the Lord seeth not.
10 Therfor and myn iye schal not spare, nether Y schal do merci; Y schal yelde the weie of hem on the heed of hem.
11 And lo! the man that was clothid in lynun clothis, that hadde a pennere in his bak, answeride a word, and seide, Y haue do, as thou comaundidist to me.

1 And Y siy, and lo! in the firmament that was on the heed of cherubyns, as a saphir stoon, and as the fourme of licnesse of a kyngis seete apperide theron.
2 And he seide to the man that was clothid in lynnun clothis, and spak, Entre thou in the myddis of wheelis, that ben vndur cherubyns, and fille thin hond with coolis of fier, that ben bitwixe cherubyns, and schede thou out on the citee.
3 And he entride in my siyt; forsothe cherubyns stoden at the riyt side of the hous, whanne the man entride, and a clowde fillide the ynnere halle.
4 And the glorie of the Lord was reisid fro aboue cherubyns to the threisfold of the hous; and the hous was fillid with a cloude, and the halle was fillid with schynyng of the glorie of the Lord.
5 And the sown of wyngis of cherubyns was herd til to the outermere halle, as the vois of almyyti God spekynge.
6 And whanne he hadde comaundid to the man that was clothid in lynnun clothis, and hadde seid, Take thou fier fro the myddis of the wheelis, that ben bitwixe cherubyns, he entride, and stood bisidis the wheel.
7 And cherub stretchide forth his hond fro the myddis of cherubyns, to the fier that was bitwixe cherubyns; and took, and yaf in to the hondis of hym that was clothid in lynnun clothis; and he took, and yede out.
8 And the licnesse of the hond of a man apperide in cherubyns, vndur the wyngis of tho.
9 And Y siy, and lo! foure wheelis weren bisidis cherubyns; o wheel bisidis o cherub, and another wheel bisidis another cherub; forsothe the licnesse of wheelis was as the siyt of the stoon crisolitis.
10 And the biholdyng of tho was o licnesse of foure, as if a wheel be in the myddis of a wheel.
11 And whanne tho yeden, tho yeden in to foure partis; tho turneden not ayen goynge, but to the place to which that that was the firste wheel bowide to go, also othere suyden, and turneden not ayen.
12 And al the bodi of tho wheelis, and the neckis, and hondis, and wyngis of the beestis, and the cerclis, weren ful of iyen, in the cumpas of foure wheelis.
13 And he clepide tho wheelis volible, ether able to go al aboute, in myn heryng.
14 Forsothe o beeste hadde foure faces; o face was the face of cherub, and the secounde face the face of a man, and in the thridde was the face of a lioun, and in the fourthe was the face of an egle;
15 and the cherubyns weren reisid. Thilke is the beeste, which Y hadde seyn bisidis the flood Chobar.
16 And whanne cherubyns yeden, also the wheelis bisidis tho yeden to gidere; whanne cherubyns reisiden her wyngis, that tho schulden be enhaunsid fro the erthe, the wheelis abididen not stille, but also tho weren bisidis cherubyns.
17 The wheelis stooden with tho cherubyns stondynge, and weren reisid with the cherubyns reisid; for the spirit of lijf was in tho wheelis.
18 And the glorie of the Lord yede out fro the threisfold of the temple, and stood on the cherubyns.
19 And cherubyns reisiden her wyngis, and weren enhaunsid fro the erthe bifore me; and whanne tho yeden out, also the wheelis sueden; and it stood in the entryng of the eest yate of the hous of the Lord, and the glorie of God of Israel was on tho.
20 Thilke is the beeste, which Y siy vndur God of Israel, bisidis the flood Chobar. And Y vndurstood that foure cherubyns weren;
21 foure faces weren to oon, and foure wyngys weren to oon; and the licnesse of the hond of a man was vndur the wyngis of tho.
22 And the licnesse of the cheris of tho weren thilke cheeris whiche Y hadde seyn bisidis the flood Chobar; and the biholdyng of tho, and the fersnesse of ech, was to entre bifor his face.

CAP 11
1 And the spirit reiside me, and ledde me with ynne to the eest yate of the hous of the Lord, that biholdith the risyng of the sunne. And lo! in the entryng of the yate weren fyue and twenti men; and Y siy in the myddis of hem Jeconye, the sone of Assur, and Pheltie, the sone of Banaie, princes of the puple.
2 And he seide to me, Thou, sone of man, these ben the men that thenken wickidnesse, and treten the worste counsel in this citee,
3 and seien, Whether housis weren not bildid a while ago? this is the cawdrun, forsothe we ben fleischis.
4 Therfor profesie thou of hem, profesie thou, sone of man.
5 And the Spirit of the Lord felle in to me, and seide to me, Speke thou, The Lord seith these thingis, Ye hous of Israel spaken thus, and Y knewe the thouytis of youre herte;
6 ye killiden ful many men in this citee, and ye filliden the weies therof with slayn men.
7 Therfor the Lord seith these thingis, Youre slayn men, whiche ye puttiden in the myddis therof, these ben fleischis, and this is the cawdrun; and Y schal lede you out of the myddis therof.
8 Ye dredden swerd, and Y schal brynge in swerd on you, seith the Lord God.
9 And Y schal caste you out of the myddis therof, and Y schal yyue you in to the hond of enemyes, and Y schal make domes in you.
10 Bi swerd ye schulen falle doun, Y schal deme you in the endis of Israel; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
11 This schal not be to you in to a cawdrun, and ye schulen not be in to fleischis in the myddis therof; Y schal deme you in the endis of Israel,
12 and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord. For ye yeden not in myn heestis, and ye dyden not my domes, but ye wrouyten bi the domes of hethene men, that ben in youre cumpas.
13 And it was doon, whanne Y profesiede, Pheltie, the sone of Banaie, was deed; and Y felle doun on my face, and Y criede with greet vois, and seide, Alas! alas! alas! Lord God, thou makist endyng of the remenauntis of Israel.
14 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
15 and he seide, Sone of man, thi britheren, thi kynes men, and al the hous of Israel, and alle men, to whiche the dwelleris of Jerusalem seiden, Go ye awei fer fro the Lord, the lond is youun to vs in to possessioun.
16 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, For Y made hem fer among hethene men, and for Y scateride hem in londis, Y schal be to hem in to a litil halewyng, in the londis to whiche thei camen.
17 Therfor speke thou, The Lord God seith these thingis, Y schal gadere you fro puplis, and Y schal gadere you togidere fro londis, in whiche ye ben scatered; and Y schal yyue the erthe of Israel to you.
18 And thei schulen entre thidur, and schulen do awei alle offenciouns, and alle abhomynaciouns therof in that dai.
19 And Y schal yyue to hem oon herte, and Y schal yyue a newe spirit in the entrails of hem; and Y schal take awei a stony herte fro the fleisch of hem, and Y schal yyue to hem an herte of fleisch;
20 that thei go in my comaundementis, and kepe my domes, and do tho; and that thei be in to a puple to me, and Y be in to God to hem.
21 But of whiche the herte goith after her offendyngis and abhomynaciouns, Y schal sette the weie of hem in her heed, seith the Lord God.
22 And the cherubyns reisiden her wyngis, and the wheelis yeden with tho, and the glorie of God of Israel was on tho.
23 And the glorie of the Lord stiede fro the myddis of the citee, and stood on the hil, which is at the eest of the citee.
24 And the spirit reiside me, and brouyte me in to Caldee, to the passyng ouer, in visioun bi the spirit of God; and the visioun which Y hadde seyn, was takun awei fro me.
25 And Y spak to the passyng ouer alle the wordis of the Lord, whiche he hadde schewid to me.

3 Therfor thou, sone of man, make to thee vessels of passing ouer, and thou schalt passe ouer bi dai bifor hem; forsothe thou schalt passe ouer fro thi place to another place, in the siyt of hem, if perauenture thei biholden, for it is an hous terrynge to wraththe.
4 And thou schalt bere withoutforth thi vessels, as the vessels of a man passynge ouer bi dai, in the siyt of hem; sotheli thou schalt go out in the euentid bifore hem, as a man passynge forth goith out.
5 Bifore the iyen of hem digge the wal to thee, and thou

9 and he seide, Sone of man, whether the hous of Israel, the hous terrynge to wraththe, seiden not to thee, What doist thou?
10 Seie thou to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, This birthun is on the duyk, which is in Jerusalem, and on al the hous of Israel, which is in the myddis of hem.
11 Seie thou, Y am youre signe of thing to comynge; as Y dide, so it schal be don to hem; thei schulen go in to passynge ouer, and in to caitifte.
12 And the duyk which is in the myddis of hem, schal be borun out on schuldris, and he schal go out in derknesse; thei schulen digge the wal, and lede hym out; his face schal be hilid, that he se not with iye the erthe.
13 And Y schal stretche forth my net on hym, and he schal be takun in my net; and Y schal lede hym in to Babiloyne, in to the lond of Caldeis, and he schal not se that lond, and he schal die there.
14 And Y schal scatere in to ech wynd alle men that ben aboute hym, his help, and hise cumpenyes; and Y schal draw out the swerd aftir hem.
15 And thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, whanne Y schal scatere hem among hethene men, and schal sowe hem abrood in londis.
16 And Y schal leue of hem a fewe men fro swerd, and hungur, and pestilence, that thei telle out alle the grete trespassis of hem among hethene men, to which thei schulen entre; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
17 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
18 and he seide, Thou, sone of man, ete thi breed in disturblyng, but also drynke thi water in haaste and mourening.
19 And thou schalt seie to the puple of the lond, The Lord God seith these thingis to hem that dwellen in Jerusalem, in the lond of Israel, Thei schulen ete her breed in angwisch, and thei schulen drynke her watir in desolacioun; that the lond be desolat of his multitude, for the wickidnesse of alle men that dwellen ther ynne.
20 And citees that ben now enhabitid, shulen be desolat, and the lond schal be forsakun; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
21 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
22 and he seide, Sone of man, what is this prouerbe to you, of men seiynge in the lond of Israel, Daies schulen be differrid in to long tyme, and ech visioun shal perische?
23 Therfor seie thou to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, Y schal make this prouerbe to ceesse, and it schal no more be seid comynli in Israel; and speke thou to hem, that the daies han neiyid, and ech word of profesie.
24 For whi ech visioun schal no more be voide, nether bifor tellyng of thing to comynge schal be douteful in the myddis of the sones of Israel;

26 And the word of the Lord was maad to me, and he seide, Thou,

3 Here ye the word of the Lord. The Lord God seith these thingis, Wo to the vnwise profetis, that suen her spirit, and seen no thing;
4 Israel, thi profetis weren as foxis in desert.
5 Ye stieden not euene ayens, nether ayensettiden a wal for the hous of Israel, that ye shulden stonde in batel in the dai of the Lord.
6 Thei seen veyn thingis, and deuynen a leesyng, and seien, The Lord seith, whanne the Lord sente not hem; and thei contynueden to conferme the word.
7 Whether ye seen not a veyn visioun, and spaken fals diuynyng, and seiden, The Lord seith, whanne Y spak not?
8 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, For ye spaken veyn thingis, and sien a leesyng, therfor lo! Y to you, seith the Lord God.
9 And myn hond schal be on the profetis that seen veyn thingis, and dyuynen a leesyng; thei schulen not be in the councel of my puple, and thei schulen not be writun in the scripture of the hous of Israel, nether thei schulen entre in to the lond of Israel; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord God.
10 For thei disseyueden my puple, and seiden, Pees, pees, and no pees is; and it bildide a wal, but thei pargitiden it with fen with out chaffis.
11 Seie thou to hem that pargiten with out temperure, that it schal falle doun; for a strong reyn schal be flowynge, and I shal yyue ful grete stoones fallinge fro aboue, and Y schal yyue a wynd of tempest that distrieth.
12 For lo! the wal felle doun. Whether it schal not be seid to you, Where is the pargetyng, which ye pargetiden?
13 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, And Y schal make the spirit of tempestis to breke out in myn indignacioun, and strong reyn flowynge in my strong veniaunce schal be, and greet stoonys in wraththe in to wastyng.
14 And Y schal distrie the wal, which ye pargetiden with out temperure, and Y schal make it euene with the erthe; and the foundement therof schal be schewid, and it schal falle doun, and it schal be wastid in the myddis therof; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
15 And Y schal fille myn indignacioun in the wal, and in hem that pargeten it with out temperure; and Y schal seie to you, The wal is not, and thei ben not,
16 that pargeten it, the profetis of Israel, that profesien to Jerusalem, and seen to it the visioun of pees, and pees is not, seith the Lord God.
17 And thou, sone of man, sette thi face ayens the douytris of thi puple, that profesien of her herte; and profesie thou on hem,

19 And thei defouliden me to my puple, for an handful of barli, and for a gobet of breed, that thei schulden sle soulis that dien not, and quykene soulis that lyuen not; and thei lieden to my puple, bileuynge to leesyngis.
20 For this thing the Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y to youre cuschens, bi whiche ye disseyuen soulis fliynge; and Y schal al to-breke tho fro youre armes, and Y schal delyuere soulis which ye disseyuen, soulis to fle.

22 For that that ye maden falsli the herte of a iust man to morene, whom Y made not sori; and ye coumfortiden the hondis of a wickid man, that he schulde not turne ayen fro his yuel weie, and lyue.
23 Therfor ye schulen not se veyn thingis, and ye schulen no more dyuyne false dyuynyngis; and Y schal delyuere my puple fro youre hond, and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.

6 Therfor seie thou to the hous of Israel, The Lord God seith these thingis, Be ye conuertid, and go ye awei fro youre idols, and turne awei youre faces fro alle youre filthis.
7 For whi a man, a man of the hous of Israel, and of conuersis, who euer is a comelyng in Israel, if he is alienyd fro me, and settith hise idols in his herte, and settith stidfastli the sclaundir of his wickidnesse ayens his face, and he cometh to the profete, to axe me bi hym, Y the Lord schal answere hym bi my silf.
8 And Y schal sette my face on that man, and Y schal make hym in to ensaumple, and in to a prouerbe, and Y schal leese hym fro the myddis of my puple; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
9 And whanne a profete errith, and spekith a word, Y the Lord schal disseyue that profete; and Y schal stretche forth myn hond on hym, and Y schal do hym awei fro the myddis of my puple Israel.
10 And thei schulen bere her wickidnesse; bi the wickidnesse of the axere, so the wickidnesse of the profete schal be;
11 that the hous of Israel erre no more fro me, nether be defoulid in alle her trespassyngis; but that it be in to a puple to me, and Y be in to a God to hem, seith the Lord of oostis.
12 And the word of the Lord was maad to me, and he seide,
13 Sone of man, whanne the lond synneth ayens me, that it trespassynge do trespas, Y schal stretche forth myn hond on it, and Y schal al to-breke the yerde of breed therof; and Y schal sende hungur in to it, and Y schal sle of it man and beeste.

3 The Lord God seith these thingis. A! thou Jerusalem, thi rote and thi generacioun is of the lond of Canaan; thi fadir is Amorrei, and thi moder is Cetei.
4 And whanne thou were borun, thi nawle was not kit awei in the dai of thi birthe, and thou were not waischun in watir in to helthe, nethir saltid with salt, nether wlappid in clothis.
5 An iye sparide not on thee, that it hauynge merci on thee, dide to thee oon of these thingis; but thou were cast forth on the face of erthe, in the castynge out of thi soule, in the dai in which thou were borun.
6 Forsothe Y passide bi thee, and Y siy thee defoulid in thi blood; and Y seide to thee, whanne thou were in thi blood, Lyue thou; sotheli Y seide to thee in thi blood, Lyue thou.
7 Y yaf thee multiplied as the seed of a feeld, and thou were multiplied, and maad greet; and thou entridist, and camest fulli to wymmens ournyng; thi tetis wexiden greet, and thin heer wexide; and thou were nakid, and ful of schenschipe.
8 And Y passide bi thee, and Y siy thee, and lo! thi tyme, the tyme of louyeris; and Y spredde abrood my clothing on thee, and Y hilide thi schenschipe. And Y swoor to thee, and Y made a couenaunt with thee, seith the Lord God, and thou were maad a wijf to me.
9 And Y waischide thee in water, and Y clenside awei thi blood fro thee, and Y anoyntide thee with oile.
10 And Y clothide thee with clothis of dyuerse colours, and Y schodde thee in iacynct, and Y girde thee with biys;
11 and Y clothide thee with sutil thingis, and Y ournede thee with ournement.
12 And Y yaf bies in thin hondis, and a wrethe aboute thi necke; and Y yaf a ryng on thi mouth, and cerclis to thin eeris, and a coroun of fairnesse in thin heed.
13 And thou were ourned with gold and siluer, and thou were clothid with biys and ray cloth with rounde ymagis, and many colours. Thou etist cleene flour of wheete, and hony, and oile, and thou were maad fair ful greetli; and thou encreessidist in to a rewme,
14 and thi name yede out in to hethene men for thi fairnesse; for thou were perfit in my fairnesse which Y hadde sett on thee, seith the Lord God.
15 And thou haddist trist in thi fairnesse, and didist fornicacioun in thi name; and thou settidist forth thi fornicacioun to ech that passide forth, that thou schuldist be maad his.
16 And thou tokist of my clothis, and madist to thee hiy thingis set aboute on ech side; and thou didist fornycacioun on tho, as it was not don, nether schal be don.
17 And thou tokist the vessels of thi fairnesse, of my gold and of my siluer, which Y yaf to thee; and thou madist to thee ymagis of men, and didist fornycacioun in tho.
18 And thou tokist thi clothis of many colours, and thou were clothid in tho; and thou settidist myn oile and myn encence in the siyt of tho.
19 And thou settidist my breed, which Y yaf to thee, flour of wheete, and oile, and hony, bi whiche Y nurschide thee, in the siyt of tho, in to odour of swetnesse; and it was don, seith the Lord God.
20 And thou tokist thi sones and thi douytris, whiche thou gendridist to me, and offridist to tho, for to be deuourid. Whether thi fornicacioun is litil?
21 Thou offridist my sones, and yauest hem, and halewidist to tho.
22 And aftir alle thin abhomynaciouns and fornicaciouns, thou bithouytist not on the daies of thi yong wexynge age, whanne thou were nakid, and ful of schenschipe, and were defoulid in thi blood.
23 And after al thi malice, wo, wo bifelle to thee, seith the Lord God.
24 And thou bildidist to thee a bordel hous, and madist to thee a place of hordom in alle stretis.
25 At ech heed of the weie thou bildidist a signe of thin hordom, and madist thi fairnesse abhomynable; and thou departidist thi feet to ech man passynge forth, and multepliedist thi fornicaciouns.
26 And thou didist fornicacioun with the sones of Egipt, thi neiyboris of grete fleischis, and thou multepliedist thi fornicacioun, to terre me to wraththe.
27 Lo! Y schal stretch forth myn hond on thee, and Y schal take awei thi iustifiyng; and Y schal yyue thee in to the soulis of hem that haten thee, of the douytris of Palestyns, that ben aschamed in thi weie ful of greet trespas.
28 And thou didist fornicacioun with the sones of Assiriens, for thou were not fillid yit; and after that thou didist fornicacioun, nether so thou were fillid.
29 And thou multipliedist thi fornycacioun in the lond of Canaan with Caldeis, and nether so thou were fillid.
30 In what thing schal Y clense thin herte, seith the Lord God, whanne thou doist alle these werkis of a womman an hoore, and gredi axere?
31 For thou madist thi bordel hous in `the heed of ech weie, and thou madist thin hiy place in ech street; and thou were not maad as an hoore ful of anoiyng,
32 encreessynge prijs, but as a womman auowtresse, that bryngith in aliens on hir hosebonde.
33 Hiris ben youun to alle hooris, but thou hast youe hire to alle thi louyeris; and thou yauest to hem, that thei schulden entre to thee on ech side, to do fornycacioun with thee.
34 And it was don in thee ayens the custom of wymmen in thi fornycaciouns, and fornicacioun schal not be after thee; for in that that thou yauest hiris, and tokist not hiris, the contrarie was don in thee.
35 Therfor, thou hoore, here the word of the Lord.
36 The Lord God seith these thingis, For thi riches is sched out, and thi schenschipe is schewid in thi fornicaciouns on thi louyeris, and on the idols of thin abhomynaciouns, in the blood of thi sones, whiche thou yauest to hem; lo!
37 Y schal gadere to gidere alle thi louyeris, with whiche thou were meddlid, and alle men whiche thou louedist, with alle men whiche thou hatidist; and Y schal gadere hem on thee on ech side, and Y schal make nakid thi schenschipe bifore hem, and thei schulen se al thi filthe.
38 And Y schal deme thee bi the domes of auoutressis, and schedinge out blood;
39 and Y schal yyue thee in to the blood of strong veniaunce, and of feruour. And Y schal yyue thee in to the hondis of hem, and thei schulen destrie thi bordel hous, and thei schulen destrie the place of thin hordom; and thei schulen make thee nakid of thi clothis, and thei schulen take awei the vessels of thi fairnesse, and thei schulen forsake thee nakid, and ful of schenschipe.
40 And thei schulen bringe on thee a multitude, and thei schulen stoon thee with stoonys, and thei schulen sle thee with her swerdis.
41 And thei schulen brenne thin housis with fier, and thei schulen make domes in thee, bifor the iyen of ful many wymmen; and thou schalt ceese to do fornicacioun, and thou schalt no more yyue hiris.
42 And myn indignacioun schal reste in thee, and my feruent loue schal be takun awei fro thee; and Y schal reste, and Y schal no more be wrooth,
43 for thou haddist not mynde on the daies of thi yong wexynge age, and thou terridist me to ire in alle these thingis. Wherfor and Y yaf thi weies in thin heed, seith the Lord God, and Y dide not aftir thi grete trespassis, in alle these thin abhomynaciouns.
44 Lo! ech man that seith a prouerbe comynli, schal take it in thee,
45 and schal seie, As the modir, so and the douytir of hir. Thou art the douyter of thi modir, that castide awey hir hosebonde and hir sones; and thou art the sister of thi sistris, that castiden a wei her hosebondis and her sones. Thi modir is Cetei, and thi fadir is Ammorrei;
46 and thi gretter sister is Samarie, sche and hir douytris, that dwellen at thi left side; but thi sistir lesse than thou, that dwellith at thi riyt side, is Sodom, and hir douytris.
47 But thou yedist not in the weies of hem, nethir thou didist aftir the grete trespassis of hem; hast thou do almest a litil lesse cursidere dedis than thei, in alle thi weies?
48 Y lyue, seith the Lord God, for Sodom, thi sister, did not, sche and hir douytris, as thou didist, and thi douytris.
49 Lo! this was the wickidnesse of Sodom, thi sister, pride, fulnesse of breed, and habundaunce, and idilnesse of hir, and of hir douytris; and thei puttiden not hond to a nedi man and pore.
50 And thei weren enhaunsid, and diden other abhominaciouns bifore me; and Y took hem awei, as thou hast seyn.
51 And Samarie synnede not the half of thi synnes, but thou hast ouercome hem in thi grete trespassis; and thou hast iustified thi sistris in alle thin abhomynaciouns, whiche thou wrouytist.
52 Therfor and thou bere thi schenschipe, that hast ouercome thi sistris with thi synnes, and didist more cursidli than thei; for thei ben iustified of thee. Therfor and be thou schent, and bere thi schenschipe, which hast iustified thi sistris.
53 And Y schal conuerte and restore hem by the conuersioun of Sodom with hir douytris, and bi the conuersioun of Samarie and of hir douytris; and Y schal conuerte thi turnyng ayen in the myddis of hem,
54 that thou bere thi schenschipe, and be aschamed in alle thingis whiche thou didist, coumfortynge hem.
55 And thi sister Sodom and hir doytris schulen turne ayen to her eldnesse; and Samarie and hir douytris shulen turne ayen to her eeldnesse; and thou and thi douytris turne ayen to youre eldnesse.
56 Forsothe Sodom, thi sister, was not herd in thi mouth, in the dai of thi pride,
57 bifore that thi malice was schewid, as in this tyme, in to schenschipe of the douytris of Sirie, and of alle douytris in thi cumpas, of the douytris of Palestyn that ben aboute thee bi cumpas.
58 Thou hast bore thi greet trespas, and thi schenschipe, seith the Lord God.
59 For the Lord God seith these thingis, And Y schal do to thee as thou dispisidist the ooth, that thou schuldist make voide the couenaunt;
60 and Y schal haue mynde on my couenaunt with thee in the daies of thi yongthe, and Y schal reise to thee a couenaunt euerlastynge.
61 And thou schalt haue mynde on thi weies, and schalt be aschamed, whanne thou schalt resseyue thi sistris grettere than thou, with thi lesse sistris; and Y schal yyue hem in to douytris to thee, but not of thi couenaunt.
62 And Y schal reise my couenaunt with thee, and thou schalt wite, that Y am the Lord, that thou haue mynde, and be aschamed;
63 and that it be no more to thee to opene the mouth for thi schame, whanne Y schal be plesid to thee in alle thingis whiche thou didist, seith the Lord God.

CAP 17
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
2 and he seide, Sone of man, sette forth a derk speche, and telle thou a parable to the hous of Israel;
3 and thou schalt seie, The Lord God seith these thingis. A greet egle of grete wyngis, with long stretchyng out of membris, ful of fetheris and of dyuersite, cam to the Liban, and took awei the merowe of the cedre.
4 He pullide awei the hiynesse of boowis therof, and bar it ouer in to the lond of Chanaan, and settide it in the citee of marchauntis.
5 And he took of the seed of the lond, and settide it in the lond for seed, that it schulde make stidfast roote on many watris; he settide it in the hiyere part.
6 And whanne it hadde growe, it encreesside in to a largere vyner, in lowe stature; for the boowis therof bihelden to that egle, and the rootis therof weren vndur that egle; therof it was maad a vyner, and it made fruyt in to siouns, and sente out boowis.
7 And another greet egle was maad, with grete wyngis, and many fetheris; and lo! this vyner as sendynge hise rootis to that egle, stretchide forth his siouns to that egle, that he schulde moiste it of the cornfloris of his seed.
8 Which is plauntid in a good lond on many watris, that it make boowis, and bere fruyt, that it be in to a greet vyner.
9 Seie thou, Ezechiel, The Lord God seith these thingis, Therfor whether he schal haue prosperite? Whether Nabugodonosor schal not pulle awei the rootis of hym, and schal streyne the fruytis of hym? And he schal make drie alle the siouns of buriowning therof, and it schal be drie; and not in greet arm, nether in myche puple, that he schulde drawe it out bi the rootis.
10 Lo! it is plauntid, therfor whether it schal haue prosperite? Whether not whanne brennynge wynd schal touche it, it schal be maad drye, and schal wexe drie in the cornfloris of his seed?
11 And the word of the Lord was maad to me, and he seide, Seie thou to the hous terrynge to wraththe,
12 Witen ye not what these thingis signefien? Seie thou, Lo! the king of Babiloyne cometh in to Jerusalem; and he schal take the kyng and the princis therof, and he schal leede hem to hym silf in to Babiloyne.
13 And he schal take of the seed of the rewme, and schal smyte with it a boond of pees, and he schal take of it an ooth; but also he schal take awei the stronge men of the lond,
14 that it be a meke rewme, and be not reisid, but that it kepe the couenaunt of hym, and holde it.
15 Which yede awei fro hym, and sente messangeris in to Egipt, that it schulde yyue to hym horsis and miche puple. Whether he that dide these thingis, schal haue prosperite, ether schal gete helthe? and whether he that brekith couenaunt, schal ascape?
16 Y lyue, seith the Lord God, for in the place of the king that made hym kyng, whos ooth he made voide, and brak the couenaunt, which he hadde with hym, in the myddis of Babiloyne he schal die.
17 And not in greet oost, nether in myche puple Farao schal make batel ayens hym, in the castyng of erthe, and in bildyng of palis, that he sle many persones.
18 For he dispiside the ooth, that he schulde breke the boond of pees, and lo! he yaf his hond; and whanne he hath do alle these thingis, he schal not ascape.
19 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, Y lyue, for Y schal sette on his heed the ooth which he dispiside, and the boond of pees which he brak.
20 And Y schal spredde abrood my net on hym, and he schal be takun in my net, and Y schal brynge hym in to Babiloyne; and there Y schal deme hym in the trespassyng, bi which he dispiside me.
21 And alle hise flieris a wei with al his cumpenye schulen falle doun bi swerd, forsothe the remenauntis schulen be schaterid in to ech wynd; and ye schulen wite, that Y the Lord spak.
22 The Lord God seith these thingis, And Y schal take of the merowe of an hiy cedre, and Y schal sette a tendir thing of the cop of hise braunchis; Y schal streyne, and Y schal plaunte on an hiy hil, and apperynge fer.
23 In the hiy hil of Israel Y schal plaunte it; and it schal breke out in to buriownyng, and it schal make fruyt, and it schal be in to a greet cedre, and alle briddis schulen dwelle vndur it; ech volatil schal make nest vndur the schadewe of hise boowis.
24 And alle trees of the cuntrei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord; Y made low the hiy tre, and Y enhaunside the low tre, and Y made drie the greene tree, and Y made the drie tree to brynge forth boowis; Y the Lord haue spoke, and Y haue do.

CAP 18
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
2 and he seide, What is it, that ye turnen a parable among you in to this prouerbe, in the lond of Israel, and seien, Fadris eeten a bittir grape, and the teeth of sones ben an egge, ether astonyed?
3 Y lyue, seith the Lord God, this parable schal no more be in to a prouerbe to you in Israel.
4 Lo! alle soulis ben myne; as the soule of the fadir, so and the soule of the sone is myn. Thilke soule that doith synne, schal die.
5 And if a man is iust, and doith doom and riytfulnesse,
6 etith not in hillis, and reisith not hise iyen to the idols of the hous of Israel; and defoulith not the wijf of his neiybore, and neiyeth not to a womman defoulid with vncleene blood;
7 and makith not a man sori, yeldith the wed to the dettour, rauyschith no thing bi violence, yyueth his breed to the hungri, and hilith a nakid man with a cloth;
8 leeneth not to vsure, and takith not more; turneth awei his hond fro wickidnesse, and makith trewe dom bitwixe man and man;
9 and goith in my comaundementis, and kepith my domes, that he do treuthe; this is a iust man, he schal lyue in lijf, seith the Lord God.
10 That if he gendrith a sone, a theef, shedinge out blood,
11 and doith oon of thes thingis, and sotheli not doing alle these thingis, but etinge in hillis, and defoulynge the wijf of his neiybore;
12 makynge soreuful a nedy man and pore, rauyschynge raueyns, not yeldinge a wed, reisynge hise iyen to idols, doynge abhomynacioun; yiuynge to vsure, and takynge more;
13 whether he schal lyue? he schal not lyue; whanne he hath do alle these abhomynable thingis, he schal die bi deth, his blood schal be in hym.
14 That if he gendrith a sone, which seeth alle the synnes of his fadir, whiche he dide, and dredith, and doith noon lijk tho;
15 etith not on hillis, and reisith not hise iyen to the idols of the hous of Israel; and defoulith not the wijf of his neiybore,
16 and makith not sori a man, witholdith not a wed, and rauyschith not raueyn, yyueth his breed to the hungri, and hilith the nakid with a cloth;
17 turneth a wei his hond fro the wrong of a pore man, takith not vsure and ouerhabundaunce, `that is, no thing more than he lente, and doith my domes, and goith in my comaundementis; this sone schal not die in the wickidnesse of his fadir, but he schal lyue in lijf.
18 For his fadir made fals caleng, and dide violence to his brother, and wrouyte yuel in the myddis of his puple, lo! he is deed in his wickidnesse.
19 And ye seien, Whi berith not the sone the wickidnesse of the fadir? That is to seie, for the sone wrouyte doom and riytfulnesse, he kepte alle my comaundementis, and dide tho, he schal lyue in lijf.
20 Thilke soule that doith synne, schal die; the sone schal not bere the wickidnesse of the fadir, and the fadir schal not bere the wickednesse of the sone; the riytfulnesse of a iust man schal be on hym, and the wickidnesse of a wickid man schal be on hym.
21 Forsothe if a wickid man doith penaunce of alle hise synnes whiche he wrouyte, and kepith alle myn heestis, and doith dom and riytfulnesse, he schal lyue bi lijf, and schal not die.
22 Y schal not haue mynde of alle his wickidnessis whiche he wrouyte; he schal lyue in his riytfulnesse which he wrouyte.
23 Whether the deth of the wickid man is of my wille, seith the Lord God, and not that he be conuertid fro his weies, and lyue?
24 Forsothe if a iust man turneth awey hym silf fro his riytfulnesse, and doith wickidnesse bi alle hise abhomynaciouns, which a wickid man is wont to worche, whether he schal lyue? Alle hise riytfulnessis whiche he dide, schulen not be had in mynde; in his trespassyng bi which he trespasside, and in his synne which he synnede, he schal die in tho.
25 And ye seiden, The weie of the Lord is not euene. Therfor, the hous of Israel, here ye, whether my weie is not euene, and not more youre weies ben schrewid?
26 For whanne a riytful man turneth awei hym silf fro his riytfulnesse, and doith wickidnesse, he schal die in it, he schal die in the vnriytwisnesse which he wrouyte.
27 And whanne a wickid man turneth awei him silf fro his wickidnesse which he wrouyte, and doith dom and riytfulnesse, he schal quykene his soule.
28 For he biholdinge and turnynge awei hym silf fro alle hise wickidnessis which he wrouyte, schal lyue in lijf, and schal not die.
29 And the sones of Israel seien, The weie of the Lord is not euene. Whether my weies ben not euene, ye hous of Israel, and not more youre weies ben schrewid?
30 Therfor, thou hous of Israel, Y schal deme ech man bi hise weies, seith the Lord God. Turne ye togidere, and do ye penaunce for alle youre wickidnessis, and wickidnesse schal not be to you in to falling.
31 Caste awei fro you alle youre trespassingis, bi whiche ye trespassiden, and make ye a newe herte and a newe spirit to you, and whi schulen ye die, the hous of Israel?
32 For Y nyle the deeth of hym that dieth, seith the Lord God; turne ye ayen, and lyue ye.

1 And thou, sone of man, take weiling on the princes of Israel;
2 and thou schalt seie, Whi thi modir, a lionesse, lai among liouns? In the myddis of litle liouns sche nurschide hir whelpis,
3 and ledde out oon of hir litle liouns; he was maad a lioun, and he lernyde to take prei, and to ete men.
4 And hethene men herden of hym, and token hym not withouten her woundis; and thei brouyten hym in chaynes in to the lond of Egipt.
5 Which modir whanne sche hadde seyn, that sche was sijk, and the abiding of hym perischide, took oon of her litle liouns, and made hym a lioun.
6 Which yede among liouns, and was maad a lioun;
7 and lernede to take prey, and to deuoure men. He lernyde to make widewis, and to brynge the citees of men in to desert; and the lond and the fulnesse therof was maad desolat, of the vois of his roryng.
8 And hethene men camen togidere ayens hym on ech side fro prouynces, and spredden on hym her net; he was takun in the woundis of tho hethene men.
9 And thei senten hym in to a caue in chaines, and brouyten hym to the kyng of Babiloyne; and thei senten hym in to prisoun, that his vois were no more herd on the hillis of Israel.
10 Thi modir as a vyner in thi blood was plauntid on watre; the fruitis therof and the boowis therof encreessiden of many watris.
11 And sadde yerdis weren maad to it in to septris of lordis, and the stature therof was enhaunsid among boowis; and it siy his hiynesse in the multitude of hise siouns.
12 And it was drawun out in wraththe, and was cast forth in to erthe; and a brennynge wynd dryede the fruyt therof, and the yerdis of strengthe therof welewiden, and weren maad drie, and fier eet it.
13 And now it is plauntid ouer in desert, in a lond with out weie, and thristi.
14 And fier yede out of the yerde of the braunchis therof, that eet the fruyt therof. And a stronge yerde, the ceptre of lordis, was not in it. It is weilyng, and it schal be in to weilyng.

CAP 20
1 And it was doon in the seuenthe yeer, in the fyuethe monethe, in the tenthe dai of the monethe, men of the eldris of Israel camen to axe the Lord; and thei saten bifor me.
2 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
3 and he seide, Sone of man, speke thou to the eldere men of Israel; and thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, Whether ye camen to axe me? Y lyue, for Y schal not answere to you, seith the Lord God. Sone of man,
4 if thou demest hem, if thou demest, schewe thou to hem the abhomynaciouns of her fadris.
5 And thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, In the dai in which Y chees Israel, and reiside myn hond for the generacioun of the hous of Jacob, and Y apperide to hem in the lond of Egipt, and Y reiside myn hond for hem, and Y seide, Y am youre Lord God,
6 in that dai Y reiside myn hond for hem, that Y schulde leede hem out of the lond of Egipt, in to the lond which Y hadde purueiede to hem, the lond flowynge with mylk and hony, which is noble among alle londis.
7 And Y seide to hem, Ech man caste awei the offenciouns of hise iyen, and nyle ye be defoulid in the idols of Egipt; Y am youre Lord God.
8 And thei terriden me to wraththe, and nolden here me; ech man castide not awei the abhomynaciouns of hise iyen, nether thei forsoken the idols of Egipt.
9 And Y seide, that Y wold schede out myn indignacioun on hem, and fille my wraththe in hem, in the myddis of the lond of Egipt. And Y dide for my name, that it schulde not be defoulid bifore hethene men, in the myddis of whiche thei weren, and among whiche Y apperide to hem, that Y schulde lede hem out of the lond of Egipt.
10 Therfor Y castide hem out of the lond of Egipt, and Y ledde hem out in to desert;
11 and Y yaf to hem my comaundementis, and Y schewide to hem my doomes, which a man schal do, and lyue in tho.
12 Ferthermore and Y yaf to hem my sabatis, that it schulde be a sygne bitwixe me and hem, and that thei schulden wite, that Y am the Lord halewynge hem.
13 And the hous of Israel terriden me to wraththe in desert; thei yeden not in my comaundementis, and thei castiden awei my domes, whiche a man that doith, schal lyue in tho; and thei defouliden greetli my sabatis. Therfor Y seide, that Y wolde schede out my strong veniaunce on hem in desert, and waste hem;
14 and Y dide for my name, lest it were defoulid bifor hethene men, fro whiche Y castide hem out in the siyt of tho.
15 Therfor Y reiside myn hond on hem in the desert, that Y brouyte not hem in to the lond which Y yaf to hem, the lond flowynge with mylk and hony, the beste of alle londis.
16 For thei castiden awei my domes, and yeden not in my comaundementis, and thei defouliden my sabatis; for the herte of hem yede after idols.
17 And myn iye sparide on hem, that Y killide not hem, nether Y wastide hem in the desert.
18 Forsothe Y seide to the sones of hem in wildirnesse, Nyle ye go in the comaundementis of youre fadris, nether kepe ye the domes of hem, nethir be ye defoulid in the idols of hem.
19 Y am youre Lord God, go ye in my comaundementis, and kepe ye my domes, and do ye tho.
20 And halowe ye my sabatis, that it be a signe bitwixe me and you, and that it be knowun, that Y am youre Lord God.
21 And the sones terriden me to wraththe, and yeden not in my comaundementis, and kepten not my domes, that thei diden tho, whiche whanne a man hath do, he schal lyue in tho, and thei defouliden my sabatis. And Y manaasside to hem, that Y wolde schede out my stronge veniaunce on hem, and fille my wraththe in hem in the desert.
22 But Y turnede awei myn hond, and Y dide this for my name, that it were not defoulid bifore hethene men, fro whiche Y castide hem out bifore the iyen of tho.
23 Eft Y reiside myn hond ayens hem in wildirnesse, that Y schulde scatere hem in to naciouns, and wyndewe hem in to londis;
24 for that that thei hadden not do my domes, and hadden repreuyd my comaundementis, and hadden defoulid my sabatis, and her iyen hadden be after the idols of her fadris.
25 Therfor and Y yaf to hem comaundementis not good, and domes in whiche thei schulen not lyue.
26 And Y defoulide hem in her yiftis, whanne thei offriden to me for her trespassis al thing that openeth the wombe; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
27 Wherfor speke thou, sone of man, to the hous of Israel, and thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, Yit and in this youre fadris blasfemyden me, whanne thei dispisynge hadden forsake me,
28 and Y hadde brouyte hem in to the lond on which Y reiside myn hond, that Y schulde yiue to hem, thei siyen ech hiy litil hil, and ech tree ful of boowis, and thei offriden there her sacrifices, and thei yauen there her offryngis, in to terring to wraththe; and thei settiden there the odour of her swetnesse, and thei offriden her moiste sacrifices.
29 And Y seide to hem, What is the hiy thing, to whiche ye entren? And the name therof is clepid Hiy Thing til to this dai.
30 Therfor seie thou to the hous of Israel, The Lord God seith these thingis, Certis ye ben defoulid in the weie of youre fadris, and ye don fornycacioun aftir the offendingis of hem,
31 and in the offryng of youre yiftis, whanne ye leden ouer youre sones bi fier, ye ben defoulid in alle youre idols til to dai, and schal Y answere to you, the hous of Israel? Y lyue, seith the Lord God, for Y schal not answere to you;
32 nether the thouyte of youre soul schal be don, that seien, We schulen be as hethene men, and as naciouns of erthe, that we worschipe trees and stoonys.
33 Y lyue, seith the Lord God, for in strong hond, and in arm stretchid forth, and in strong veniaunce sched out, I schal regne on you.
34 And Y schal lede out you fro puplis, and Y schal gadere you fro londis, in whiche ye ben scaterid; in strong hond, and in arm stretchid forth, and in strong veniaunce sched out Y schal regne on you.
35 And Y schal bringe you in to desert of puplis, and Y schal be demed there with you face to face.
36 As Y stryuede in doom ayens youre fadris in the desert of the lond of Egipt, so Y schal deme you, seith the Lord;
37 and Y schal make you suget to my septre, and Y schal bringe in you in the boondis of pees.
38 And Y schal chese of you trespassouris, and wickid men; and Y schal leede hem out of the lond of her dwelling, and thei schulen not entre in to the lond of Israel; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
39 And ye, the hous of Israel, the Lord God seith these thingis, Go ye ech man aftir youre idols, and serue ye tho. That and if ye heren not me in this, and defoulen more myn hooli name in youre yiftis,
40 and in youre idols, in myn hooli hil, in the hiy hil of Israel, seith the Lord God, ye schulen be punyschid greuousliere. There al the hous of Israel schal serue me, sotheli alle men in the lond, in which thei schulen plese me; and there Y schal seke youre firste fruytis, and the bigynnyng of youre tithis in alle youre halewyngis.
41 Y schal resseiue you in to odour of swetnesse, whanne Y schal leede you out of puplis, and schal gadere you fro londis, in whiche ye weren scaterid; and Y schal be halewid in you bifor the iyen of naciouns.
42 And ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, whanne Y schal bringe you in to the lond of Israel, in to the lond for which Y reiside myn hond, that Y schulde yyue it to youre fadris.
43 And ye schulen haue mynde there on youre weies, and on alle youre grete trespassis, bi whiche ye ben defoulid in tho; and ye schulen displese you in youre siyt, in alle youre malices whiche ye diden.
44 And ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, whanne Y schal do wel to you for my name; not bi youre yuel weies, nether bi youre worste trespassis, ye hous of Israel, seith the Lord God.
45 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,

3 And thou schalt seie to the lond of Israel, The Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y to thee, and Y schal caste my swerd out of his schethe, and Y schal sle in thee a iust man and a wickid man.
4 Forsothe for that that Y haue slayn in thee a iust man and a wickid man, therfor my swerd schal go out of his schethe to ech man, fro the south til to the north;
5 that ech man wite, that Y the Lord haue drawe out my swerd fro his schethe, that schal not be clepid ayen.
6 And thou, sone of man, weile in sorewe of leendis, and in bitternessis thou schalt weile bifore hem.
7 And whanne thei schulen seie to thee, Whi weilist thou? thou schalt seie, For hering, for it cometh; and ech herte shal faile, and alle hondis schulen be aclumsid, and ech spirit schal be sike, and watris schulen flete doun bi alle knees; lo! it cometh, and it shal be don, seith the Lord God.
8 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
9 and he seide, Sone of man, profesie thou; and thou schalt seie, The Lord God seith these thingis, Speke thou, The swerd, the swerd is maad scharp, and is maad briyt;
10 it is maad scharp to sle sacrifices; it is maad briyt, that it schyne. Thou that mouest the ceptre of my sone, hast kit doun ech tree.
11 And Y yaf it to be forbischid, that it be holdun with hond; this swerd is maad scharp, and this is maad briyt, that it be in the hond of the sleere.
12 Sone of man, crie thou, and yelle, for this swerd is maad in my puple, this in alle the duykis of Israel; thei that fledden ben youun to swerd with my puple. Therfor smite thou on thin hipe, for it is preuyd;

14 Therfor, sone of man, profesie thou, and smyte thou hond to hond, and the swerd be doublid, and the swerd of sleeris be treblid; this is the swerd of greet sleyng, that schal make hem astonyed,
15 and to faile in herte, and multiplieth fallingis. In alle the yatis of hem Y yaf disturbling of a swerd, scharp and maad briyt to schyne, gird to sleynge.
16 Be thou maad scharp, go thou to the riyt side, ether to the left side, whidur euer the desir of thi face is.
17 Certis and Y schal smyte with hond to hond, and Y schal fille myn indignacioun; Y the Lord spak.
18 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
19 and he seide, And thou, sone of man, sette to thee twei weies, that the swerd of the king of Babiloyne come; bothe schulen go out of o lond, and bi the hond he schal take coniecting; he schal coniecte in the heed of the weie of the citee,
20 settinge a weye, that the swerd come to Rabath of the sones of Amon, and to Juda in to Jerusalem moost strong.
21 For the king of Babiloyne stood in the meeting of twey weies, in the heed of twei weies, and souyte dyuynyng, and medlide arowis; he axide idols, and took councel at entrails.
22 Dyuynyng was maad to his riyt side on Jerusalem, that he sette engyns, that he opene mouth in sleyng, that he reise vois in yelling, that he sette engyns ayens the yatis, that he bere togidere erthe, that he bilde strengthinges.
23 And he shal be as counceling in veyn goddis answer bifor the iyen of hem, and seruynge the reste of sabatis; but he schal haue mynde on wickidnesse, to take.
24 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, For that that ye hadden mynde on youre wickidnesse, and schewiden youre trespassyngis, and youre synnes apperiden in alle youre thouytis, forsothe for that that ye hadden mynde, ye schulen be takun bi hond.
25 But thou, cursid wickid duyk of Israel, whos dai bifor determyned is comun in the tyme of wickidnesse,

27 Wickidnesse, wickidnesse, wickidnesse Y schal putte it; and this schal not be doon til he come, whos the doom is, and Y schal bitake to hym.
28 And thou, sone of man, profesie, and seie, The Lord God seith these thingis to the sones of Amon, and to the schenschipe of hem; and thou schalt seie, A! thou swerd, A! thou swerd, drawun out to sle, maad briyte, that thou sle and schyne,

32 Thou schalt be mete to fier, thi blood schal be in the middis of erthe; thou schalt be youun to foryetyng, for Y the Lord spak.

CAP 22
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
2 and he seide, And thou, sone of man, whether thou demest not the citee of bloodis?
3 And thou schalt schewe to it alle hise abhomynaciouns, and thou schalt seie, The Lord God seith these thingis, This is a citee schedinge out blood in the myddis of it silf, that the tyme therof come; and which made idols ayens it silf, that it shulde be defoulid.
4 In thi blood which is shed out of thee, thou trespassidist, and thou art defoulid in thin idols whiche thou madist; and thou madist thi daies to neiye, and thou brouytist the time of thi yeeris. Therfor Y yaf thee schenschipe to hethene men, and scornyng to alle londis that ben niy thee,
5 and that ben fer fro thee; thou foul citee, noble, greet in perisching, thei schulen haue victorie of thee.
6 Lo! princes of Israel, alle in her arm, weren in thee, to schede out blood.
7 Thei punyschiden with wrongis fadir and modir in thee, thei calengiden falsli a comelyng in the myddis of thee, thei maden sori a fadirles child and a widewe at thee.
8 Ye dispisiden my seyntuaries, and ye defouliden my sabatis.
9 Men bacbiteris weren in thee, to schede out blood, and eten on hillis in thee; thei wrouyten greet trespas in the myddis of thee.
10 Thei vnhiliden the schamefulere thingis of the fadir in thee, thei maden low in thee the vnclenesse of a womman in vnclene blood.
11 And ech man wrouyte abhomynacioun ayens the wijf of his neiybore, and the fadir of the hosebonde defoulide his sones wijf vnleuefuli; a brother oppresside in thee his sister, the douytir of his fadir.
12 Thei token yiftis at thee, to schede out blood; thou tokist vsure and ouerabundaunce, and thou calengidist greedili thi neiyboris, and thou hast foryete me, seith the Lord God.
13 Lo! Y haue smyte togidere myn hondis on thin aueryce, which thou didist, and on the blood which is sched out in the myddis of thee.
14 Whether thin herte schal susteyne, ether thin hondis schulen haue power in the daies whiche Y schal make to thee? For Y the Lord spak, and Y schal do.
15 And Y schal scatere thee in to naciouns, and Y schal wyndewe thee in to londis; and Y schal make thin vnclennesse to faile fro thee,
16 and Y schal welde thee in the siyt of hethene men; and thou schalt wite, that Y am the Lord.
17 And the word of the Lord was maad to me, and he seide,
18 Thou, sone of man, the hous of Israel is turned to me in to dros, ether filthe of irun; alle these ben bras, and tyn, and irun, and leed, in the myddis of furneis, thei ben maad the dros of siluer.
19 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, For that alle ye ben turned in to dros, lo! Y schal gadere you togidere in the myddis of Jerusalem,
20 bi gadering togidere of siluer, and of latoun, and of irun, and of tyn, and of leed, in the myddis of furneis; and Y schal kindle ther ynne a fier, to welle togidere; so Y schal gadere you togidere in my strong veniaunce, and in my wraththe, and Y schal reste. And Y schal welle you togidere,
21 and Y schal gadere you togidere, and Y schal sette you a fier in the fier of my strong veniaunce, and ye schulen be wellid togidere in the myddis therof.
22 As siluer is wellid togidere in the myddis of a furneis, so ye schulen be in the myddis therof; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, whanne Y haue sched out myn indignacioun on you.
23 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,

25 Sweringe togidere, ether conspiringe of profetis is in the myddis therof; as a lioun roringe and takinge prei, thei deuouriden men, thei token richessis and prijs; thei multiplieden widewis therof in the myddis therof.
26 Preestis therof dispisiden my lawe, and defouliden my seyntuaries; thei hadden not difference bitwixe hooli thing and vnhooli, thei vndurstoden not bitwixe defoulid thing and cleene thing; and thei turneden awei her iyen fro my sabatis, and Y was defoulid in the myddis of hem.
27 The princes therof in the myddis therof weren as wolues rauyschinge prey, to schede out blood, and to leese men, and in suynge lucris gredili.
28 Forsothe the profetis therof pargetiden hem with out temperure, and seyen veyn thingis, and dyuyneden leesingis to hem, and seiden, The Lord God seith these thingis, whanne the Lord spak not.
29 The puples of the lond calengiden fals caleng, and rauyschiden bi violence; thei turmentiden a nedi man and pore, and oppressiden a comeling bi fals caleng, with out doom.
30 And Y souyte of hem a man, that schulde sette an hegge bitwixe, and stonde set ayens me for the lond, that Y schulde not distrie it, and Y foond not.
31 And Y schedde out on hem myn indignacioun, and Y wastide hem in the fier of my wraththe; Y yeldide the weie of hem on the heed of hem, seith the Lord God.

CAP 23
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
2 and he seide, Thou, sone of man, twei wymmen weren the douytris of o modir, and diden fornycacioun in Egipt;
3 in her yonge wexynge age thei diden fornicacioun; there the brestis of hem weren maad low, and the tetis of the tyme of mariage of hem weren brokun.
4 Forsothe the names of hem ben, Oolla, the more sistir, and Ooliba the lesse sistir of hir. And Y hadde hem, and thei childiden sones and douytris; certis the names of hem ben Samarie Oolla, and Jerusalem Ooliba.
5 Therfor Oolla dide fornicacioun on me, and was wood on hir louyeris, on Assiriens neiyinge,
6 clothid with iacinct, princes, and magistratis, yonge men of coueytise, alle kniytis, and stieris of horsis.
7 And sche yaf hir fornicaciouns on hem, on alle the chosun sones of Assiriens; and in alle on whiche sche was wood, sche was defoulid in the vnclennessis of hem.
8 Ferthermore and sche lefte not hir fornicaciouns, whiche sche hadde in Egipt; for whi and thei slepten with hir in the yongthe of hir, and thei braken the tetis of the tyme of mariage of hir, and thei scheden out her fornicacioun on hir.
9 Therfor Y yaf hir in to the hondis of hir louyeris, in to the hondis of the sones of Assur, on whos letcherie sche was wood.
10 Thei diskyueriden the schenschipe of hir; thei token awei the sones and the douytris of hir, and killiden hir with swerd; and the wymmen weren maad famouse, that is, sclaundrid, and thei diden domes in hir.
11 And whanne hir sistir Ooliba hadde seyn this, sche was wood in letcherie more than that sistre, and yaf vnschamefastli hir fornicacioun on the fornicacioun of hir sistre,
12 to the sones of Assiriens, to duykis and magistratis comynge to hir, that weren clothid with dyuerse cloth, to knyytis that weren borun on horsis, and to yonge men with noble schap, to alle men.
13 And Y siy that o weie of both sistris was defoulid,
14 and sche encreesside hir fornycaciouns. And whanne sche hadde seyn men peyntid in the wal, the ymagis of Caldeis expressid with colouris,
15 and gird on the reynes with kniytis girdlis, and cappis peyntid in the heedis of hem, the foormes of alle duykis, the licnesse of the sones of Babiloyne, and of the lond of Caldeis, in which thei weren borun;
16 sche was wood on hem bi coueitise of hir iyen, and sche sente messangeris to hem in to Caldee.
17 And whanne the sones of Babiloyne weren comun to hir, to the bed of tetis, thei defouliden hir in her letcheries of virgyns; and sche was defoulid of hem, and the soule of hir was fillid of hem.
18 Also sche made nakid hir fornicaciouns, and diskyuered hir schenschipe; and my soule yede awei fro hir, as my soule hadde go awei fro hir sistir.
19 For sche multiplied hir fornicaciouns, and hadde mynde on the daies of hir yongthe, in whiche sche dide fornicacioun in the lond of Egipt.
20 And sche was wood in letcherie on the liggyng bi of hem, whos fleischis ben as the fleischis of assis, and as the membris of horsis ben the membris of hem.
21 And thou visitidist the grete trespas of thi yongthe, whanne thi brestis weren maad low in Egipt, and the tetis of the tyme of thi mariage weren brokun.
22 Therfor, thou Ooliba, the Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y schal reise alle thi louyeris ayens thee, of whiche thi soule was fillid, and Y schal gadere hem ayens thee in cumpas;
23 the sones of Babiloyne, and alle Caldeis, noble and miyti men, and princes, alle the sones of Assiriens, and yonge men of noble foorme, duykis, and magistratis, alle princes of princes, and named stieris of horsis.
24 And thei araied with chare and wheel schulen come on thee, the multitude of puplis schulen be armed with haburioun, and scheeld, and basynet, ayens thee on ech side; and Y schal yyue doom bifor hem, and thei schulen deme thee bi her domes.
25 And Y schal sette my feruour in thee, which thei schulen vse with thee in woodnesse; thei schulen kitte awei thi nose and thin eeris, and thei schulen sle with swerd tho thingis that weren left; thei schulen take thi sones and thi douytris, and thi laste thing schal be deuourid bi fier.
26 And thei schulen make thee nakid of thi clothis, and thei schulen take awei the vessels of thi glorie.
27 And Y schal make thi greet trespasse to reste fro thee, and thi fornicacioun fro the lond of Egipt; and thou schalt not reise thin iyen to hem, and thou schalt no more haue mynde on Egipt.
28 For the Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y schal yyue thee in to the hondis of hem whiche thou hatist, `in to the hondis of hem of whiche thi soule was fillid,
29 and thei schulen do with thee in hatrede. And thei schulen take awei alle thi trauels, and thei schulen leeue thee nakid, and ful of schenschipe; and the schenschipe of thi fornicaciouns schal be schewid. Thi greet
30 trespas and thi fornycaciouns han do these thingis to thee; for thou didist fornicacioun aftir hethene men, among whiche thou were defoulid in the idols of hem.
31 Thou yedist in the weie of thi sister, and Y schal yyue the cuppe of hir in thin hond.
32 The Lord God seith these thingis, Thou schalt drinke the cuppe of thi sistir, the depthe, and the broodnesse; thou that art most able to take, schalt be in to scornyng, and in to mouwyng.
33 Thou schalt be fillid with drunkenesse and sorewe, with the cuppe of mourenyng and of heuynesse, with the cuppe of thi sister Samarie.
34 And thou schalt drynke it, and thou schalt drinke of til to the drastis, and thou schalt deuoure the relifs therof, and thou schalt to-reende thi brestis, for Y the Lord spak, seith the Lord God.
35 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, For thou hast foryete me, and hast cast forth me bihynde thi bodi, bere thou also thi greet trespas and thi fornicaciouns.
36 And the Lord God seide to me, and spak, Sone of man, whether thou demest Ooliba and Oolla, and tellist to hem the grete trespassis of hem?
37 For thei diden auowtrie, and blood was in the hondis of hem, and thei diden fornicacioun with her idols; ferthermore and thei offriden to tho the sones whiche thei gendriden to me, for to be deuourid.
38 But also thei diden this to me, thei defouleden my seyntuarie in that dai, and maden vnhooli my sabatis.
39 And whanne thei sacrifisiden her sones to her idols, and entriden in to my seyntuarie in that dai, that thei schulden defoule it, thei diden also these thingis in the myddis of myn hous.
40 Thei senten to men comyng fro fer, to whiche thei hadden sent messangeris. Therfor lo! thei camen, to whiche thou waischidist thee, and anoyntidist thin iyen with oynement of wymmen, and thou were ourned with wymmens atier.
41 Thou satist in a ful fair bed, and a boord was ourned bifor thee; thou settidist myn encense and myn oynement on it.
42 And a vois of multitude makynge ful out ioye was ther ynne; and in men that weren brouyt of the multitude of men, and camen fro desert, thei settiden bies in the hondis of hem, and faire corouns on the heedis of hem.
43 And Y seide to hir, that was defoulid in auoutries, Now also this schal do fornycacioun in hir fornicacioun.
44 And thei entriden to hir; as to a womman, an hoore, so thei entriden to Oolla and to Ooliba, cursid wymmen.
45 Therfor these men ben iust, these schulen deme thilke wymmen bi the doom of auoutressis, and bi the doom of hem that scheden out blood; for thei ben auoutressis, and blood is in the hondis of hem, and thei diden fornicacioun with her idols.
46 For the Lord God seith these thingis, Bringe thou multitudis to hem, and yyue thou hem in to noise, and in to raueyn;
47 and be thei stoonyd with the stoonys of puplis, and be thei stikid togidere with the swerdis of hem. Thei schulen sle the sones and the douytris of hem, and thei schulen brenne with fier the housis of hem.
48 And Y schal do awei greet trespas fro the lond; and alle wymmen schulen lerne, that thei do not aftir the greet trespas of hem.
49 And thei schulen yyue youre grete trespas on you; and ye schulen bere the synnes of youre idols, and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord God.

CAP 24
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me, in the nynthe yeer, and in the tenthe monethe, in the tenthe dai of the monethe,
2 and he seide, Thou, sone of man, write to thee the name of this dai, in which the king of Babiloyne is confermed ayens Jerusalem to dai.
3 And thou schalt seie bi a prouerbe a parable to the hous, terrere to wraththe, and thou schalt speke to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, Sette thou a brasun pot, sette thou sotheli, and putte thou watir in to it. Take thou a beeste ful fat;
4 gadere thou togidere the gobetis therof in it, ech good part, and the hipe, and the schuldre, chosun thingis and ful of boonys.
5 Also dresse thou heepis of boonys vndur it; and the sething therof buylide out, and the boonys therof weren sodun in the myddis therof.
6 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, Wo to the citee of bloodis, to the pot whos rust is ther ynne, and the rust therof yede not out of it; caste thou out it bi partis, and bi hise partis; lot felle not on it.
7 For whi the blood therof is in the myddis therof; he schede it out on a ful cleer stoon, he schedde not it out on erthe,
8 that it mai be hilid with dust, that Y schulde bringe in myn indignacioun, and `a venge bi veniaunce; Y yaf the blood therof on a ful cleer stoon, that it schulde not be hilid.
9 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, Wo to the citee of bloodis, whos brennyng Y schal make greet;
10 gadere thou togidire boonys, whiche Y schal kyndle with fier; fleischis schulen be wastid, and al the settyng togidere schal be sodun, and boonys schulen faile.
11 Also sette thou it voide on coolis, that the metal therof wexe hoot, and be meltid, and that the filthe therof be wellid togidere in the myddis therof, and the rust therof be wastid.
12 It was swat bi myche trauel, and the ouer greet rust therof yede not out therof, nether bi fier.
13 Thin vnclennesse is abhomynable, for Y wolde clense thee, and thou art not clensid fro thi filthis; but nether thou schalt be clensid bifore, til Y make myn indignacioun to reste in thee.
14 Y the Lord spak; it schal come, and Y schal make, Y schal not passe, nethir Y schal spare, nether Y schal be plesid; bi thi weies and bi thi fyndyngis Y schal deme thee, seith the Lord.
15 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
16 and he seide, Thou, sone of man, lo! Y take awei fro thee the desirable thing of thin iyen in veniaunce, and thou schalt not weile, nether wepe, nether thi teeris schulen flete doun.

24 And Y schal coumforte the armes of the kyng of Babiloyne, and Y schal yyue my swerd in the hond of hym; and Y schal breke the armes of Farao, and men slayn bifore his face schulen weile bi weilyngis.
25 And Y schal coumforte the armes of the kyng of Babiloyne, and the armes of Farao schulen falle doun. And thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, whanne Y schal yyue my swerd in the hond of the kyng of Babiloyne; and he schal stretche forth it on the lond of Egipt.
26 And Y schal scatere Egipt in to naciouns, and Y schal wyndewe hem in to londis; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.

CAP 31
1 And it was don in the enleuenthe yeer, in the thridde moneth, in the firste dai of the monethe, the word of the Lord was maad to me,
2 and he seide, Thou, sone of man, seie to Farao, kyng of Egipt, and to his puple, To whom art thou maad lijk in thi greetnesse?
3 Lo! Assur as a cedre in Liban, fair in braunchis, and ful of boowis, and hiy bi hiynesse; and his heiyte was reisid among thicke bowis.
4 Watris nurschiden hym, the depthe of watris enhaunside him; hise floodis fletiden out in the cumpas of hise rootis, and he sente out hise strondis to alle the trees of the cuntrei.
5 Therfor his hiynesse was enhaunsid ouer alle trees of the cuntrei, and hise trees weren multiplied, and hise braunchis weren reisid, for many watris.
6 And whanne he hadde stretchid forth his schadewe, alle the volatils of the eir maden nestis in hise braunchis; and alle the beestis of forestis gendriden vndur hise boowis, and the cumpeny of ful many folkis dwellide vndur the schadewynge place of hym.
7 And he was ful fair in his greetnesse, and in alargyng of hise trees; for the roote of hym was bisidis many watris.
8 Cedris in the paradijs of God weren not hiyere than he; fir trees atteyneden not euenli to the hiynesse of hym, and plane trees weren not euene with the boowis of hym. Ech tree of paradijs of God was not maad lic hym and his fairnesse.
9 For Y made hym fair, and with many and thicke boowis; and alle the trees of lust, that weren in the paradijs of God, hadden enuye to hym.
10 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, For that that he was reisid in hiynesse, and he yaf his hyynesse greene and thicke, and his herte was reisid in his hiynesse;
11 now Y haue youe hym in to the hondis of the strongeste man of hethene men. And he doynge schal do to that Assur; aftir the vnfeithfulnesse of hym Y castide hym out.
12 And aliens, and the moost cruel men of naciouns, schulen kitte hym doun, and schulen caste hym forth on hillis. And hise braunchis schulen falle doun in alle grete valeis, and hise trees schulen be brokun in alle roochis of stoon of erthe. And alle the puplis of erthe schulen go awei fro his schadewing place, and schulen forsake hym.
13 Alle volatils of the eir dwelliden in the fallyng of hym, and alle beestis of the cuntrei weren in the braunchis of hym.
14 Wherfor alle the trees of watris schulen not be reisid in hir hiynesse, nether schulen sette hir hiynesse among places ful of woode, and ful of boowis, and alle trees that ben moistid of watris schulen not stonde in the hiynesse of tho. For alle thei ben youun in to deth, to the ferthest lond in the myddis of the sones of men, to hem that goon doun in to the lake.
15 The Lord God seith these thingis, In the dai whanne he yede doun to hellis, Y brouyte yn mourenyng; Y hilide hym with depthe of watris, and I forbede his flodis, and Y refreynede many watris. The Liban was sori on him, and alle the trees of the feeld
16 weren shakun of the soun of his falling. I mouide togidere hethene men, whanne Y ledde hym doun to helle, with hem that yeden doun in to the lake. And alle trees of likyng, noble trees, and ful cleere in the Liban, alle that weren moistid with watris, weren coumfortid in the loweste lond.
17 For whi also thei schulen go doun with hym to helle, to slayn men with swerd; and the arm of ech man schal sitte vndur the schadewyng place of hym, in the myddis of naciouns.
18 To whom art thou licned, thou noble and hiy among the trees of likyng? Lo! thou art led doun with the trees of likyng to the fertheste lond. In the myddis of vncircumcidid men thou schalt slepe, with hem that ben slayn bi swerd. Thilke is Farao, and al the multitude of hym, seith the Lord God.

CAP 32
1 And it was don in the tweluethe yeer, in the tweluethe monethe, in the firste dai of the monethe, the word of the Lord was maad to me,
2 and he seide, Thou, sone of man, take weilyng on Farao, kyng of Egipt, and thou schalt seie to hym, Thou were maad lijk to a lioun of hethene men, and to a dragoun whiche is in the see. And thou wyndewist with horn in thi floodis, and thou disturblidist watris with thi feet, and defoulidist the floodis of tho.
3 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis, Y schal spredde abrood my net on thee in the multitude of many puples, and Y schal drawe thee out in my net;
4 and Y schal caste forth thee in to erthe. On the face of the feeld Y schal caste thee awei, and Y schal make alle the volatils of heuene to dwelle on thee, and Y schal fille of thee the beestis of al erthe.
5 And Y schal yyue thi fleischis on hillis, and Y schal fille thi litle hillis with thi root;
6 and Y schal moiste the erthe with the stynk of thi blood on mounteyns, and valeis schulen be fillid of thee.
7 And whanne thou schalt be quenchid, Y schal hile heuenes, and Y schal make blak the sterris therof; Y schal kyuere the sunne with a clowde, and the moone schal not yyue hir liyt.
8 Y schal make alle the liyt yyueris of heuene to mourne on thee, and Y schal yyue derknessis on thi lond, seith the Lord God; whanne thi woundid men schulen falle doun in the myddis of erthe, seith the Lord God.
9 And Y schal terre to wraththe the herte of many puplis, whanne Y schal bringe in thi sorewe among folkis, on londis whiche thou knowist not.
10 And Y schal make many puplis to wondre on thee, and the kyngis of hem schulen drede with ful greet hidousnesse on thee, for alle thi wickidnessis whiche thou wrouytist, whanne my swerd schal bigynne to flee on the faces of hem. And alle men schulen be astonyed sudenli, for her lijf, in the dai of her fallyng.
11 For the Lord God seith these thingis, The swerd of the king of Babiloyne schal come to thee;
12 in swerdis of stronge men Y schal caste doun thi multitude, alle these folkis ben not able to be ouercomun. And thei schulen waste the pride of Egipt, and the multitude therof schal be distried.
13 And Y schal leese alle the beestis therof, that weren on ful many watris; and the foot of a man schal no more troble tho watris, nether the clee of beestis schal troble tho.
14 Thanne Y schal yelde the watris of hem clenneste, and Y schal brynge the floodis of hem as oile, seith the Lord God,
15 whanne Y schal yyue desolat the lond of Egipt. Forsothe the lond schal be forsakun of his fulnesse, whanne Y schal smyte alle the dwellers therof; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.
16 It is a weiling, and the douytris of hethene men schulen biweile hym; thei schulen biweile hym on Egipt, and thei schulen biweile hym on the multitude therof, seith the Lord God.
17 And it was don in the tweluethe yeer, in the fiftenthe dai of the monethe, the word of the Lord was maad to me,
18 and he seide, Sone of man, synge thou a song of weilyng on the multitude of Egipt, and drawe thou doun it the same, and the douytris of stronge hethene men to the laste lond, with hem that yeden doun in to the lake.
19 In as myche as thou art fairere, go doun, and slepe with vncircumcidid men.
20 In the myddis of slayn men thei schulen falle doun bi swerd; a swerd is youun, and thei drowen it to, and alle the puplis therof.
21 The myytieste of stronge men schulen speke to hym, fro the myddis of helle, whiche with her helperis yeden doun, and slepten vncircumcidid, and slayn bi swerd.
22 There is Assur, and al his multitude; the sepulcris of hem ben in the cumpas of hym, alle slayn men, and that fellen doun bi swerd,
23 whose sepulcris ben youun in the laste thingis of the lake. And the multitude of hym is maad bi the cumpas of his sepulcre, alle slayn men, and fallynge doun bi swerd, whiche yauen sum tyme her ferdfulnesse in the lond of lyuynge men.
24 There is Helam, and al the multitude therof bi the cumpas of his sepulcre; alle these weren slayn, and fallynge doun bi swerd, that yeden doun vncircumcidid to the laste lond; whiche settiden her drede in the lond of lyuynge men, and baren her schenschipe with hem that goon doun in to the lake.
25 In the myddis of slayn men thei puttiden his bed in alle the puplis of hym; his sepulcre is in the cumpas of hym. Alle these weren vncircumcidid and slayn bi swerd, for thei yauen drede in the lond of lyuynge men, and baren her schenschipe with hem that gon doun in to the lake; thei ben set in the myddis of slayn men.
26 There ben Mosoch and Tubal, and al the multitude therof; the sepulcris therof ben in the cumpasse therof. Alle these men vncircumcidid weren slayn, and fallynge doun bi swerd, for thei yauen her drede in the lond of lyuynge men.
27 And thei schulen not slepe with stronge men, and fallynge doun, and vncircumcidid, that yeden doun in to helle with her armuris, and puttiden her swerdis vndur her heedis. And the wickidnessis of hem weren in the boonys of hem, for thei weren maad the drede of stronge men in the lond of lyuynge men.
28 And thou therfor schalt be al to-foulid in the myddis of vncircumcidid men, and schalt slepe with hem that ben slayn bi swerd.
29 There is Idumee, and the kingis therof, and alle duykis therof, that ben youun with her oost, with men slayn bi swerd, and which slepten with vncircumcidid men, and with hem that yeden doun in to the lake.
30 There ben alle princes of the north, and alle hunteris, that weren led forth with slayn men, that ben dredinge and schent in her strengthe, which slepten vncircumcidid with men slayn bi swerd, and baren her schenschipe with hem that yeden doun in to the lake.
31 Farao siy hem, and was coumfortid on al his multitude that was slayn bi swerd. And Farao and al his oost, seith the Lord God, baren her schenschipe with hem that yeden doun in to the lake;
32 for he yaf his drede in the lond of lyuynge men. And Farao and al his multitude slepte in the myddis of vncircumcidid men, with men slayn bi swerd, seith the Lord God.

CAP 33
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,
2 and he seide, Thou, sone of man, speke to the sones of thi puple, and thou schalt seie to hem, A lond whanne Y bringe in a swerd on it, and the puple of the lond takith o man of hise laste men, and makith hym aspiere on hym,
3 and he seeth a swerd comynge on the lond, and sowneth with a clarioun, and tellith to the puple,
4 forsothe a man that herith, who euer he is, the sowne of the clarioun, and kepith not him silf, and the swerd cometh, and takith hym awei, the blood of hym schal be on the heed of hym.
5 He herde the sown of the clarioun, and kepte not hym silf, his blood schal be in hym; forsothe if he kepith hym silf, he schal saue his lijf.
6 That if the aspiere seeth a swerd comynge, and sowneth not with a clarioun, and the puple kepith not hym silf, and the swerd cometh, and takith awei a man of hem, sotheli he is takun in his wickidnesse; but Y schal seke the blood of hym of the hond of the aspiere.
7 And, thou, sone of man, Y yaf thee aspiere to the hous of Israel; therfor thou schalt here of my mouth a word, and schalt telle to hem of me.
8 If whanne Y seie to the wickid man, Thou, wickid man, schalt die bi deth, thou spekist not, that the wickid man kepe hym silf fro his weie, thilke wickid man schal die in his wickidnesse, but Y schal seke his blood of thin hond.
9 Forsothe if whanne thou tellist to the wickid man, that he be conuertid fro his weies, he is not conuertid fro his weie, he schal die in his wickidnesse; certis thou hast delyuered thi soule.
10 Therfore thou, sone of man, seie to the hous of Israel, Thus ye spaken, seiynge, Oure wickidnessis and oure synnes ben on vs, and we failen in tho; hou therfor moun we lyue? seie thou to hem,
11 Y lyue, seith the Lord God, Y nyle the deth of the wickid man, but that the wickid man be conuertid fro his weie, and lyue; be ye conuertid fro youre worste weies, and whi schulen ye die, the hous of Israel?
12 Therfor thou, sone of man, seie to the sones of thi puple, The riytfulnesse of a riytful man schal not delyuere hym, in whateuer dai he doith synne; and the wickidnesse of a wickid man schal not anoye him, in what euere dai he is conuertid fro his wickidnesse; and a iust man schal not mowe lyue in his riytfulnesse, in what euer dai he doith synne.
13 Also if Y seie to a iust man, that he schal lyue bi lijf, and he tristith in his riytfulnesse, and doith wickidnesse, alle his riytfulnessis schulen be youun to foryetyng, and in his wickidnesse which he wrouyte, in that he schal die.
14 Forsothe if Y seie to the wickid man, Thou schalt die bi deth, and he doith penaunce for his synne, and doith dom and riytfulnesse,
15 and if thilke wickid man restorith a wed, and yeldith raueyn, and goith in comaundementis of lijf, and doith not ony vniust thing, he schal lyue bi lijf, and schal not die.
16 Alle hise synnes which he synnede, schulen not be arettid to hym; he dide doom and riytfulnesse, he schal lyue bi lijf.
17 And the sones of thi puple seiden, The weie of the Lord is not euene weiyte; and the weie of hem is vniust.
18 For whanne a iust man goith awei fro his riytfulnesse, and doith wickidnessis, he schal die in tho;
19 and whanne a wickid man goith awei fro his wickidnesse, and doith dom and riytfulnes, he schal lyue in tho.
20 And ye seien, The weie of the Lord is not riytful. Y schal deme ech man bi hise weies of you, the hous of Israel.
21 And it was doon in the tweluethe yeer, in the tenthe monethe, in the fyuethe dai of the monethe of our passyng ouer, he that fledde fro Jerusalem cam to me, and seide, The citee is distried.
22 Forsothe the hond of the Lord was maad to me in the euentid, bifore that he cam that fledde, and he openyde my mouth, til he cam to me eerli; and whanne my mouth was openyd, Y was no more stille.
23 And the word of the Lord was maad to me, and he seide,
24 Thou, sone of man, thei that dwellen in `thingis in poynt to falle doun on the erthe of Israel, seien, spekynge, Abraham was oon, and bi eritage he hadde the lond in possessioun; forsothe we ben manye, the lond is youun to vs in to possessioun.
25 Therfor thou schalt seie to hem, The Lord God seith these thingis, Whether ye that eten in blood, and reisen youre iyen to youre vnclennessis, and scheden blood, schulen haue in possessioun the lond bi eritage?
26 Ye stoden in youre swerdis, ye diden youre abhomynaciouns, and ech man defoulide the wijf of his neiybore; and schulen ye welde the lond bi eritage?
27 Thou schalt seie these thingis to hem, Thus seith the Lord God, Y lyue, for thei that dwellen in `thingis redi to falle doun, schulen falle doun bi swerd, and he that is in the feld, schal be youun to beestis to be deuourid; but thei that ben in stronge holdis and in dennes, schulen die bi pestilence.
28 And Y schal yyue the lond in to wildirnesse, and in to desert, and the pryde and strengthe therof schal faile; and the hillis of Israel schulen be maad desolat, for noon is that schal passe bi tho.
29 And thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord, whanne Y schal yyue her lond desolat and desert, for alle her abhomynaciouns whiche thei wrouyten.
30 And thou, sone of man, the sones of thi puple that speken of thee bisidis wallis, and in the doris of housis, and seien, oon to an other, a man to his neiybore, and speken, Come ye, and here we, what is the word goynge out fro the Lord;
31 and thei comen to thee, as if my puple entrith, and my puple sitten bifore thee, and thei heren thi wordis, and doon not tho; for thei turnen tho in to the song of her mouth, and her herte sueth her auerice;
32 and it is to hem as a song of musik, which is songun bi soft and swete sown; and thei heren thi wordis, and thei doon not tho;
33 and whanne that that is bifore seide cometh, for lo! it cometh, thanne thei schulen wite, that `profetis weren among hem.

CAP 34
1 And the word of the Lord was maad to me,

3 Ye eeten mylk, and weren hilid with wollis, and ye killiden that that was fat; but ye fedden not my floc.
4 Ye maden not sad that that was vnstidfast, and ye maden not hool that that was sijk; ye bounden not that that was brokun, and ye brouyten not ayen that that was cast awei, and ye souyten not that that perischide; but ye comaundiden to hem with sturnenesse, and with power.
5 And my scheep weren scaterid, for no sheepherde was; and thei weren maad in to deuouryng of alle beestis of the feeld, and thei weren scaterid.
6 My flockis erriden in alle mounteyns, and in ech hiy hil, and my flockis weren scaterid on al the face of erthe, and noon was that souyte.
7 Therfor, scheepherdis, here ye the word of the Lord;

9 scheepherdis, here ye the word of the Lord,
10 The Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y my silf am ouer scheepherdis; Y schal seke my floc of the hond of hem, and Y schal make hem to ceesse, that thei fede no more my flok, and that the scheepherdis feede no more hem silf. And Y schal delyuere my floc fro the mouth of hem, and it schal no more be in to mete to hem.
11 For the Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y my silf schal seke my scheep, and Y schal visite hem.
12 As a scheepherde visitith his floc, in the dai whanne he is in the myddis of hise scheep `that ben scaterid, so Y schal visite my scheep; and Y schal delyuere hem fro alle places in whiche thei weren scaterid, in the dai of cloude, and of derknesse.
13 And Y schal leede hem out of puplis, and Y schal gadere hem fro londis, and Y schal brynge hem in to her lond, and Y schal feede hem in the hillis of Israel, in ryueris, and in alle seetis of erthe.
14 Y schal feede hem in moost plenteouse pasturis, and the lesewis of hem schulen be in the hiy hillis of Israel; there thei schulen reste in greene eerbis, and in fatte lesewis thei schulen be fed on the hillis of Israel.
15 Y schal fede my scheep, and Y schal make hem to ligge, seith the Lord God.
16 I schal seke that that perischide, and Y schal brynge ayen that that was cast awei; and Y schal bynde that that was brokun, and Y schal make sad that that was sijk; and Y schal kepe that that was fat and strong; and Y schal feede hem in doom;
17 forsothe ye ben my flockis. The Lord God seith these thingis, Lo! Y deme bitwixe beeste and beeste, and a wethir and a buc of geet.
18 Whether it was not enowy to you to deuoure good pasturis? Ferthermore and ye defouliden with youre feet the remenauntis of youre lesewis, and whanne ye drunken clereste watir, ye disturbliden the residue with youre feet.
19 And my scheep weren fed with tho thingis that weren defoulid with youre feet; and thei drunken these thingis, that youre feet hadden troblid.
20 Therfor the Lord God seith these thingis to you, Lo! Y my silf deme bitwixe a fat beeste and a leene beeste.
21 For that that ye hurliden with sidis, and schuldris, and wyndewiden with youre hornes alle sike beestis, til tho weren scaterid withoutforth, I schal saue my floc,
22 and it schal no more be in to raueyn. And Y schal deme bitwixe beeste and beeste;
23 and Y schal reise on tho o sheepherde, my seruaunt Dauid, that schal fede tho; he schal fede tho, and he schal be `in to a sheepherde to hem.
24 Forsothe Y the Lord schal be in to God to hem, and my seruaunt Dauid schal be prince in the myddis of hem; Y the Lord spak.
25 And Y schal make with hem a couenaunt of pees, and Y schal make worste beestis to ceesse fro erthe; and thei that dwellen in desert, schulen slepe sikur in forestis.
26 And Y schal sette hem blessyng in the cumpas of my litle hil, and Y schal lede doun reyn in his tyme. And reynes of blessyng schulen be,

3 The Lord God seith these thingis, Thou hil of Seir, lo! Y to thee; Y schal stretche forth myn hond on thee, and Y schal yyue thee desolat and forsakun.
4 Y schal distrie thi citees, and thou schalt be forsakun; and thou schalt wite, that Y am the Lord.
5 For thou were an enemye euerlastynge, and closidist togidere the sonis of Israel in to the hondis of swerd, in the tyme of her turment, in the tyme of the laste wickidnesse;
6 therfor Y lyue, seith the Lord God, for Y schal yyue thee to blood, and blood schal pursue thee; and sithen thou hatidist blood, blood schal pursue thee.
7 And Y schal yyue the hil of Seir desolat and forsakun, and Y schal take awei fro it a goere and a comere ayen;

9 Y schal yyue thee in to euerlastynge wildirnessis, and thi citees schulen not be enhabitid; and ye schulen wite, that Y am the Lord God.
10 For thou seidist, Twei folkis and twei londis schulen be myne, and Y schal welde tho bi eritage, whanne the Lord was there;

13 And ye han rise on me with youre mouth, and ye han deprauyd ayens me; Y herde youre wordis.
14 The Lord God seith these thingis, While al the lond is glad, Y schal turne thee in to wildernesse.
15 As thou haddist ioie on the eritage of the hous of Israel, for it was distried, so Y schal do to thee; the hil of Seir schal be distried, and al Ydumee; and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord.

1 Forsothe thou, sone of man, profesie on the hillis of Israel; and thou schalt seie, Hillis of Israel, here ye the word of the Lord.
2 The Lord God seith these thingis, For that that the enemy seide of you, Wel! euerlastyng hiynessis ben youun to vs in to eritage;

6 But in the dai of calendis he schal offre a calf with out wem of the droue; and sixe lambren, and wetheris schulen be with out wem,

8 And whanne the prince schal entre, entre he bi the weie of the porche of the yate, and go he out bi the same weie.
9 And whanne the puple of the lond schal entre in the siyt of the Lord, in solempnytees, which puple entrith bi the yate of the north, for to worschipe, go it out bi the wei of the south yate. Certis the puple that entrith bi the weie of the south yate, go out bi the weie of the north yate. It schal not turne ayen bi the weie of the yate, bi which it entride, but euene ayens that weie it schal go out.
10 Forsothe the prince schal be in the myddis of hem; he schal entre with hem that entren, and he schal go out with hem that goen out.
11 And in feiris and in solempnytees, the sacrifice of ephi schal be bi a calf, and ephi bi a wether; in lambren schal be sacrifice as his hond fyndith, and of oile the mesure hyn, bi ech ephi.
12 Forsothe whanne the prince makith a wilful brent sacrifice, ether wilful pesible sacrifice to the Lord, the yate that biholdith to the eest, schal be openyd to hym; and he schal make his brent sacrifice, and hise pesible sacrifices, as it is wont to be doon in the dai of sabat; and he schal go out, and the yate schal be closid after that he yede out.
13 And he schal make brent sacrifice ech day to the Lord, a lomb with out wem of the same yeer; euere he schal make it in the morewtid,
14 and he schal make sacrifice on it ful eerli; eerli he schal make the sixte part of ephi, and of oile the thridde part of hyn, that it be meddlid with the floure of wheete; it is a lawful sacrifice, contynuel and euerlastinge, to the Lord.
15 He schal make a lomb, and sacrifice, and oile, ful eerli; he schal make eerli brent sacrifice euerlastynge.
16 The Lord God seith these thingis, If the prince yyueth an hous to ony of hise sones, the eritage of hym schal be of hise sones; thei schulen welde it bi eritage.
17 Forsothe if he yyueth a biquest of his eritage to oon of hise seruauntis, it schal be his `til to the yeer of remyssioun, and it schal turne ayen to the prince; forsothe the eritage of hym schal be to hise sones.
18 And the prince schal not take bi violence of the eritage of the puple, and of the possessioun of hem; but of his owne possessioun he schal yyue eritage to hise sones, that my puple be not scaterid, ech man fro his possessioun.
19 And he ledde me in bi the entryng, that was on the side of the yate, in to the treseries of the seyntuarie to the preestis, whiche treseries bihelden to the north; and there was a place goynge to the west.
20 And he seide to me, This is the place where prestis schulen sethe, bothe for synne and for trespas; where thei schulen sethe sacrifice, that thei bere not out in to the outermere halle, and the puple be halewid.
21 And he ledde me out in to the outermere halle, and ledde me aboute bi the foure corneris of the halle; and lo! a litil halle was in the corner of the halle, alle litil hallis bi the corneris of the halle;
22 in foure corneris of the halle litle hallis weren disposid, of fourti cubitis bi lengthe, and of thretti bi breede;
23 foure weren of o mesure; and a wal bi cumpas yede aboute foure litle hallis; and kychenes weren maad vndur the porchis bi cumpas.
24 And he seide to me, This is the hous of kichenes, in which the mynystris of the hous of the Lord schulen sethe the sacrifices of the puple.

CAP 47
1 And he turnede me to the yate of the hous; and lo! watris yeden out vndur the threisfold of the hous to the eest; for the face of the hous bihelde to the eest; forsothe the watris camen doun in to the riyt side of the temple, to the south part of the auter.
2 And he ledde me out bi the weie of the north yate, and he turnede me to the weie with out the outermere yate, to the weie that biholdith to the eest; and lo! watris flowynge fro the riyt side,
3 whanne the man that hadde a coord in his hond, yede out to the eest. And he mat a thousynde cubitis, and ledde me ouer thorou the water til to the heelis.
4 And eft he mat a thousynde, and ledde me ouer thorouy the watir `til to the knees.
5 And eft he mat a thousynde, and ledde me ouer thorouy the watir `til to the reynes. And he mat a thousynde, the stronde which Y myyte not passe; for the depe watris of the stronde hadden wexe greet, that mai not be waad ouer.
6 And he seide to me, Certis, sone of man, thou hast seyn. And he seide to me; and he turnede me to the ryuere of the stronde.
7 And whanne Y hadde turned me, lo! in the ryuer of the stronde ful many trees on euer either side.
8 And he seide to me, These watris that goon out to the heepis of soond of the eest, and goen doun to pleyn places of desert, schulen entre in to the see, and schulen go out; and the watris schulen be heelid.
9 And ech lyuynge beeste that creepith, schal lyue, whidur euere the stronde schal come; and fischis many ynow schulen be, aftir that these watris comen thidur, and schulen be heelid, and schulen lyue; alle thingis to whiche the stronde schal come, schulen lyue.
10 And fisshers schulen stonde on tho watris; fro Engaddi `til to Engallym schal be driyng of nettis; ful many kyndis of fischis therof schulen be, as the fischis of the greet see, of ful greet multitude;
11 but in brynkis therof and in maraisis watris shulen not be heelid, for tho `schulen be youun in to places of makynge of salt.
12 And ech tree berynge fruit schal growe on the stronde, in the ryueris therof on ech side; a leef therof schal not falle doun, and the fruyt therof schal not faile; bi alle monethis it schal bere firste fruytis, for the watris therof schulen go out of the seyntuarie; and the fruytis therof schulen be in to mete, and the leeuys therof to medicyn.
13 The Lord God seith these thingis, This is the ende, in which ye schulen welde the lond, in the twelue lynagis of Israel; for Joseph hath double part.
14 Forsothe ye schulen welde it, ech man euenli as his brother; on which Y reiside myn hond, that Y schulde yyue to youre fadris; and this lond schal falle to you in to possessioun.
15 This is the ende of the lond at the north coost fro the grete see, the weie of Bethalon to men comynge to Sedala,
16 Emath, Beroth, Sabarym, which is in the myddis bitwixe Damask and niy coostis of Emath, the hous of Thichon, which is bisidis the endis of Auran.
17 And the ende schal be fro the see `til to the porche of Ennon, the ende of Damask, and fro the north til to the north, the ende of Emath; forsothe this is the north coost.
18 Certis the eest coost fro the myddis of Auran, and fro the myddis of Damask, and fro the myddis of Galaad, and fro the myddis of the lond of Israel, is Jordan departynge at the eest see, also ye schulen mete the eest coost.
19 Forsothe the south coost of myddai is fro Thamar til to the watris of ayenseiyng of Cades; and the stronde til to the greet see, and the south coost at myddai.
20 And the coost of the see is the greet see, fro the niy coost bi streiyt, til thou come to Emath; this is the coost of the see.
21 And ye schulen departe this lond to you bi the lynagis of Israel;
22 and ye schulen sende it in to eritage to you, and to comelyngis that comen to you, that gendriden sones in the myddis of you; and thei schulen be to you as men borun in the lond among the sones of Israel; with you thei schulen departe possessioun, in the myddis of the lynages of Israel.
23 Forsothe in what euer lynage a comelyng is, there ye schulen yyue possessioun to hym, seith the Lord God.
