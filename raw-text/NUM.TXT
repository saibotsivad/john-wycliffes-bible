13 and hath slept with another man, and the hosebonde may not take ether preue this, but the auowtrye is hid, and may not be preuyd bi witnessis, for sche is not foundun in leccherie;
14 if the spirit of gelousie stirith the housebonde ayens his wijf, which is ether defoulid, ethir is apechid bi fals suspecioun,
15 the man schal brynge hir to the preest, and he schal offre an offryng for  hir `the tenthe part of a mesure clepid satum of barli meele; he schal not schede oyle ther onne, nethir he schal putte encense, for it is the sacrifice of gelousie, and an offryng enquerynge auowtrye.
16 Therfor the preest schal offre hir, and schal sette bifore the Lord;
17 and he schal take holi watir in `a vessel of erthe, and he schal putte in to it a litil of the erthe of the pawment of the tabernacle.
18 And whanne the womman stondith in the siyt of the Lord, he schal diskyuere hir heed, and he schal putte `on the hondis of hir the sacrifice of remembryng, and the offryng of gelousie. Sotheli he schal holde moost bittir watris, in whiche he gaderide togidere cursis with cursyng.
19 And he schal conioure hir, and schal seie, If an alien man slepte not with thee, and if thou art not defoulid in the forsakyng the bed of the hosebonde, these bittereste watris schulen not anoye thee, in to whiche Y haue gaderid togidere cursis;
20 ellis if thou bowidst awei fro thin hosebonde, and art defoulid, and hast leyn with another man,
21 thou schalt be suget to these cursyngys; the Lord yyue thee in to cursyng, and in to ensaumple of alle men in his puple; `the Lord make thin hipe to wexe rotun, and thi wombe swelle, and be brokun;
22 cursid watris entre in to thi wombe, and while the wombe swellith, thin hipe wexe rotun. And the womman schal answere, Amen! amen!
23 And the preest schal write thes cursis in a litil book, and he schal do awey tho cursis with bittereste watris, in to whiche he gaderide cursis,
24 and he schal yyue to hir to drynke. And whanne sche hath drunke tho watris,
25 the preest schal take of hir hond the sacrifice of gelousie, and he schal reise it bifor the Lord, and he schal  putte on the auter;
26 so oneli that he take bifore an handful of sacrifice `of that that is offrid, and brenne on the auter, and so yyue drynke to the womman the moost bittere watris.
27 And whanne sche hath drunke tho watris, if sche is defoulid, and is gilti of auowtrie, for the hosebonde is dispisid, the watris of cursyng schulen passe thorouy hir, and while the wombe is bolnyd, the hipe schal wexe rotun, and the womman schal be in to cursyng and in to ensaumple to al the puple.
28 That if sche is not pollutid, sche schal be harmeles, and schal brynge forth fre children.
29 This is the lawe of gelousie, if a womman bowith awei fro hir hosebonde, and is defoulid,
30 and the hosebonde is stirid with the spirit of gelousye, and bryngith hir in to the `siyt of the Lord, and the preest doith to hir bi alle thingis that ben writun, the hosebonde schal be with out synne,
31 and sche schal resseyue hir wickidnesse.

CAP 6
1 And the Lord spak to Moises and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
2 and thou schalt seie to hem, Whanne a man ether a womman makith auow, that thei be halewid, and thei wolen halewe hem silf to the Lord,
3 thei schulen absteyne fro wyn and fro al thing that may make drunkun; thei schulen not drynke vynegre of wyn, and of ony other drynkyng, and what euer thing is pressid out of the grape; thei schulen not ete freisch grapis and drie,
4 alle dayes in whiche thei ben halewid bi a vow to the Lord; thei schulen not ete what euer thing may be of the vyner, fro a grape dried `til to the draf.
5 In al tyme of his departyng a rasour schal not passe on his heed, `til to the day fillid in which he is halewid to the  Lord; he schal be hooli while the heer of his heed `schal wexe.
6 In al the tyme of his halewing he schal not entre on a deed bodi,
7 and sotheli he schal not be defoulid on the deed bodi of fadir and of moder, of brothir and of sistir, for the halewyng of his God is on his heed;
8 ech dai of his departyng schal be hooli to the Lord.
9 But if ony man is deed sudeynly bifore hym, the heed of his halewyng schal be defoulid, which he schal schaue anoon in the same dai of his clensyng, and eft in the seuenthe dai;
10 forsothe in the eiyte dai he schal offre twei turtlis, ether twei `briddis of a culuer, to the preest, in the entryng of the boond of pees of witnessyng.
11 And the preest schal make oon for synne, and the tothir in to brent sacrifice; and the preest schal preie for hym, for he synnede on a deed bodi, and he schal halewe his heed in that dai.
12 And he schal halewe to the Lord the daies of his departyng, and he schal offre a lomb of o yeer for synne, so netheles that the formere daies be maad voide, for his halewyng is defoulid.
13 This is the lawe of consecracioun. Whanne the daies schulen be fillid, whiche he determynede by a vow, the preest schal brynge hym to the dore of the tabernacle of boond of pees, and schal offre his offryng to the Lord,
14 a lomb of o yeer with out wem, in to brent sacrifice, and a scheep of o yeer with outen wem, for synne, and a ram with out wem, a pesible sacrifice;
15 also a panyere of theerf looues, that ben spreynt togidere with oile, and cakis sodun in watir, and aftir anoyntid with oile, with out sourdow, and fletyng sacrifices of alle bi hem silf;
16 whiche the preest schal offre bifor the Lord, and schal make as wel for synne as in to brent sacrifice.
17 Sotheli he schal offre the ram a pesible sacrifice to the Lord, and he  schal offre togidere a panyere of therf looues and fletyng sacryfices, that ben due bi custom.
18 Thanne the Nazarei schal be schauun fro the heer of his consecracioun, bifor the doore of the tabernacle of boond of pees; and the preest schal take hise heeris, and schal putte on the fier, which is put vndur the sacrifice of pesible thingis.
19 And he schal take the schuldur sodun of the ram, and o `cake of breed with out sourdow fro the panyere, and o theerf caak first sodun in watir and aftirward fried in oile, and he schal bitake in the hondis of the Nazarei, aftir that his heed is schauun.
20 And the preest schal reise in the `siyt of the Lord the thingis takun eft of hym. And the thingis halewid schulen be the preestis part, as the brest which is comaundid to be departid, and the hipe. Aftir these thingis the Nasarey may drynke wyn.
21 This is the lawe of the Nasarei, whanne he hath avowyd his offryng to the Lord in the tyme of his consecracioun, outakun these thingis whiche his hond fyndith. By this that he avowide in soule, so he schal do, to the perfeccioun of his halewyng.
22 And the Lord spak to Moyses and seide,
23 Speke thou to Aaron and to hise sones, Thus ye schulen blesse the sones of Israel, and ye schulen seie to hem,
24 The Lord blesse thee, and kepe thee;
25 the Lord schewe his face to thee, and haue mercy on thee;
26 the Lord turne his cheer to thee, and yyue pees to thee.
27 Thei schulen clepe inwardli my name on the sones of Israel, and Y schal blesse hem.

CAP 8
1 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to Aaron,

3 And Aaron dide, and puttide lanternes on the candilstike, as the Lord comaundide to Moises.
4 Sotheli this was the makyng of the candilstike; it was of gold betun out with hameris, as wel the myddil stok as alle thingis that camen forth of euer eithir side of the yeerdis; bi the saumple `whych the Lord schewide to Moises, so he wrouyte the candilstike.
5 And the Lord spak to Moises,
6 and seide, Take thou Leuytis fro the myddis of the sones of Israel;
7 and thou schalt clense hem bi this custom. Be thei spreynt with watir of clensyng, and schaue thei alle the heeris of her fleisch. And whanne thei han waische her clothis and ben clensid, take thei an oxe of drooues,
8 and the fletyng sacrifice therof, flour spreynt to gidere with oile; forsothe thou schalt take another oxe of the drooue for synne;
9 and thou schalt present the Leuytis bifor the tabernacle of boond of pees, whanne al the multitude of the sones of Israel is clepid togidere.
10 And whanne the Leuytis ben bifor the Lord, the sones of Israel schulen sette her hondis on hem;
11 and Aaron schal offre the Leuytis in the siyt of the Lord, a yifte of the sones of Israel, that thei serue in the seruice `of hym.
12 Also the Leuytis schulen sette her hondis on the heedis of the oxun, of whiche oxun thou schalt make oon for synne, and the tother in to brent sacrifice of the Lord, that thou preye for hem.
13 And thou schalt ordeyne the Leuytis in the siyt of Aaron, and of hise sones, and thou schalt sacre hem offrid to the Lord;
14 and thou schalt departe hem fro the myddis of the sones of Israel, that thei be myne.
15 And aftirward entre thei in to the tabernacle of  boond of pees, that thei serue me; and so thou schalt clense and schalt halewe hem, in to an offryng of the Lord, for bi fre yifte thei ben youun to me of the sones of Israel.
16 Y haue take hem for the firste gendrid thingis that openen ech wombe in Israel;
17 for alle the firste gendrid thingis of the sones of Israel ben myne, as wel of men as of beestis, fro the dai in which Y smoot ech firste gendrid thing in the loond of Egipt, Y halewide hem to me.
18 And Y took the Leuytis for alle the firste gendrid children of the sones of Israel;
19 and Y yaf hem bi fre yifte to Aaron and hise sones, fro the myddis of the puple, that thei serue me for Israel, in the tabernacle of boond of pees, and that thei preie for hem, lest veniaunce be in the puple, if thei ben hardi to neiye to the seyntuarye.
20 And Moises and Aaron, and al the multitude of the sones of Israel, diden on the Leuitis tho thingis that the Lord comaundide to Moyses.
21 And thei weren clensid, and thei waischiden her clothis; and Aaron reiside hem in the siyt of the Lord, and preiede for hem,
22 that thei schulen be clensid, and schulden entre to her offices in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, bifor Aaron and hise sones; as the Lord comaundide to Moises of the Leuytis, so it was don.
23 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, This is lawe of Leuytis;
24 fro fyue and twentithe yeer and aboue thei schulen entre, for to mynystre in the tabernacle of boond of pees;
25 and whanne thei han fillid the fiftithe yeer of age, thei schulen ceesse to serue.
26 And thei schulen be the mynystris of her bretheren in the tabernacle of boond of pees, that thei kepe tho thingis that ben bitakun to hem; sothely thei schulen not do tho werkis; thus thou schalt dispose Leuytis in her kepyngis.


CAP 9
1 And the Lord spak to Moises, in the deseert of Synay, in the secounde yeer aftir that thei yeden out of the lond of Egipt, in the firste moneth,
2 and seide, The sones of Israel make pask in his tyme,
3 in the fourtenthe day of this monethe, at the euentid, bi alle the cerymonyes and iustifiyngis therof.
4 And Moises comaundide to the sones of Israel, that thei schulden make pask;
5 whiche maden in his tyme, in the fourtenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid, in the hil of Synai; bi alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to Moises, the sones of Israel diden.
6 Lo! forsothe summen vncleene on the soule of man, that myyten not make pask in that dai, neiyiden to Moises and Aaron,
7 and seiden to hem, We ben vncleene `on the soule of man; whi ben we defraudid, that we moun not offre an offryng to the Lord in his tyme, among the sones of Israel?
8 To whiche Moises answeride, Stonde ye, that Y take counseil, what the Lord comaundith of you.
9 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
10 Speke thou to the sones of Israel, A man of youre folk which is vncleene `on the soule, ether in the weie fer, make he pask to the Lord in the secounde monethe,
11 in the fourtenthe dai of the monethe, at euentid; with therf looues and letusis of the feeld he schal ete it.
12 Thei schulen not leeue ony thing therof til the morewtid, and thei schulen not breke a boon therof; thei schulen kepe al the custom of pask.
13 Forsothe if ony man is bothe cleene, and is not in the weie, and netheles made not pask, thilke man schal be distried fro hise puplis, for he offeride not sacrifice to the Lord in his tyme; he schal bere his synne.
14 Also if a pilgrym and comelyng is anentis you, make he pask to the Lord, bi the cerymonyes  and iustifiyngis therof; the same comaundement schal be anentis you, as wel to a comelyng as to a man borun in the loond.
15 Therfore in the dai in which the tabernacle was reisid, a cloude hilide it; sotheli as the licnesse of fier was on the tente fro euentid til the morewtid.
16 Thus it was don continueli, a cloude hilide it bi dai, and as the licnesse of fier bi nyyt.
17 And whanne the cloude that hilide the tabernacle was takun awei, thanne the sones of Israel yeden forth, and in the place where the cloude stood, there thei settiden tentis.
18 At the comaundement of the Lord thei yeden forth, and at his comaundement thei settiden the tabernacle. In alle daies in whiche the cloude stood on the tabernacle, thei dwelliden in the same place.
19 And if it bifelde that it dwellide in myche tyme on the tabernacle, the sones of Israel weren in the watchis of the Lord, and thei yeden not forth,
20 in hou many euer daies the cloude was on the tabernacle. At the comaundement of the Lord thei reisiden tentis, and at his comaundement thei diden doun.
21 If the cloude was fro euentid `til to the morewtid, and anoon in the morewtid hadde left, thei yeden forth; and if aftir a dai and nyyt it hadde go awei, thei scateriden, `ether diden doun, tentis.
22 Whether in two monethis, ether in o monethe, ether in lengere tyme, `the cloude hadde be on the tabernacle, the sones of Israel dwelliden in the same place, and yeden not forth; but anoon as it hadde go awey, thei moueden tentis.
23 Bi the word of the Lord thei settiden tentis, and bi his word thei wenten forth; and thei weren in the watchis of the Lord, bi his comaundement, bi the hond of Moyses.


CAP 10
1 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
2 Make to thee twei siluerne trumpis betun out with hameris, bi whiche thou maist clepe togidere the multitude, whanne the tentis schulen be moued.
3 And whanne thou schalt sowne with trumpis, al the cumpeny schal be gaderid to thee at the dore of the tabernacle of the boond of pees.
4 If thou schalt sowne onys, the princes and the heedis of the multitude of Israel schulen come to thee;
5 but if a lengere and departid trumpyng schal sowne, thei that ben at the eest coost schulen moue tentis first.
6 Forsothe in the secounde sown and lijk noise of the trumpe thei that dwellen at the south schulen reise tentis; and bi this maner othere men schulen do, whanne the trumpis schulen sowne in to goyng forth.
7 Forsothe whanne the puple schal be gederid to gidere, symple cry of trumpis schal be, and tho schulen not sowne departyngli.
8 The sones of Aaron preest schulen sowne with trumpis, and this schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge in youre generaciouns.
9 If ye schulen go out of youre lond to batel ayens enemyes that fiyten ayens you, ye schulen crye with trumpis sownynge, and the bithenkyng of you schal be bifor youre Lord God, that ye be delyuered fro the hondis of youre enemyes.
10 If ony tyme ye schulen haue a feeste, and halidaies, and calendis, ye schulen synge in trumpis on brent sacrifices and pesible sacrifices, that tho be to you in to remembryng of youre God; Y am youre Lord God.
11 In the secounde yeer, in the secounde monethe, in the twentithe dai of the monethe, the cloude was reisid fro the tabernacle of boond of pees.
12 And the sones of Israel yeden forth bi her cumpenyes fro deseert  of Synay; and the cloude restide in the wildirnesse of Faran.
13 And the sones of Juda bi her cumpenyes, of whiche the prince was Naason, the sone of Amynadab, moueden first tentis,
14 bi the Lordis comaundement maad in the hond of Moises.
15 In the lynage of the sones of Ysacar the prince was Nathanael, the sone of Suar.
16 In the lynage of Sabulon the prince was Heliab, the sone of Helon.
17 And the tabernacle was takun doun, which the sones of Gerson and of Merary baren, and `yeden out.
18 And the sones of Ruben yeden forth bi her cumpenyes and ordre, of whiche the prince was Helisur, the sone of Sedeur.
19 Forsothe in the lynage of the sones of Symeon the prince was Salamyel, the sone of Surisaddai.
20 Sotheli in the lynage of Gad the prince was Helisaphath, the sone of Duel.
21 And the sones of Caath yeden forth, and baren the seyntuarie; so longe the tabernacle was borun, til thei camen to the place of reisyng therof.
22 Also the sones of Effraym, bi her cumpanyes, moueden tentis, in whos oost the prince was Elisama, the sone of Amyud.
23 Forsothe in the lynage of the sones of Manasses the prince was Gamaliel, the sone of Phadussur.
24 And in the lynage of Beniamyn the duk was Abidan, the sone of Gedeon.
25 The sones of Dan, bi her cumpenyes, yeden forth the laste of alle tentis, in whos oost the prince was Aizer, the sone of Amysaddai.
26 Sotheli in the lynage of the sones of Aser the prince was Phegiel, the sone of Ochran.
27 And in the lynage of the sones of Neptalym the prince was Haira, the sone of Henan.
28 These ben the castels and the goinges forth of the sones of Israel, bi her cumpenyes, whanne thei yeden out.
29 And Moises seide to Heliab, the sone of Raguel, of Madian, his alie `ethir fadir of his wijf, We goon forth to the place which the Lord schal yyue to vs; come  thou with vs, that we do wel to thee, for the Lord bihiyte goode thingis to Israel.
30 To whom he answeride, Y schal not go with thee, but Y schal turne ayen in to my lond, in which Y was borun.
31 And Moises seide, Nyle thou forsake vs, for thou knowist in whiche places we owen to sette tentis, and thou schalt be oure ledere;
32 and whanne thou schalt come with vs, what euer thing schal be the beste of the richessis whiche the Lord schal yyue to vs, we schulen yyue to thee.
33 And therfor thei yeden forth fro the hil of the Lord the weie of thre daies; and the arke of boond of pees of the Lord yede bifor hem, bi thre daies, and purueyde the place of tentis.
34 And the cloude of the Lord was on hem bi day, whanne thei yeden.
35 And whanne the arke was reisid, Moises seide, Ryse thou, Lord, and thin enemyes be scaterid, and thei that haten thee, fle fro thi face;
36 forsothe whanne the arke was put doun, he seide, Lord, turne ayen to the multitude of the oost of Israel.

CAP 11
1 Yn the meene tyme the grutchyng of the puple, as of men sorewynge for trauel, roos ayens the Lord. And whanne Moises hadde herd this thing, he was wrooth; and the fier of the Lord was kyndelid on hem, and deuouride the laste part of the tentis.
2 And whanne the puple hadde cried to Moises, Moises preiede the Lord, and the fier was quenchid.
3 And he clepid the name of that place Brennyng, for the fier of the Lord was kyndlid ayens hem.
4 And the comyn puple of `malis and femalis, that hadde stied with hem, brent with desire of fleischis, and sat, and wepte with the sones of Israel ioyned togidere to hem, and seide, Who schal yyue to vs fleischis to ete?
5 We thenken on the  fischis whiche we eten in Egipt freli; gourdis, and melouns, and lekis, and oyniouns, and garlekis comen in to mynde `to vs;
6 oure soule is drie; oure iyen byholden noon other thing `no but manna.
7 Forsothe manna was as the seed of coriaundre, of the colour of bdellyum, which is whijt and briyt as cristal.
8 And the puple yede aboute, and gaderide it, and brak with a queerne stoon, ether pownede in a morter, and sethide in a pot; and made therof litle cakis of the sauour, as of breed maad with oile.
9 And whanne dew cam doun in the niyt on the tentis, also manna cam doun togidere.
10 Therfor Moises herde the puple wepynge bi meynees, and `alle bi hem silf bi the doris of her tentis; and the woodnesse of the Lord was wrooth greetli, but also the thing was seyn vnsuffrable to Moises.
11 And he seide to the Lord, Whi hast thou turmentid thi seruaunt? whi fynde Y not grace bifor thee? and whi hast thou put on me the burthun of al this puple?
12 whethir Y conseyuede al this multitude, ethir gendride it, that thou seie to me, Bere thou hem in thi bosum as a nurise is wont to bere a litil yong child, and bere thou in to the lond for which thou hast swore to the fadris `of hem.
13 wherof ben fleischis to me, that Y `yyue to so greet multitude? Thei wepen bifore me, and seyn, `Yyue thou fleischis to vs that we ete;
14 I mai not aloone suffre al this puple, for it is greuouse to me.
15 If in other maner it semeth to thee, Y biseche that thou sle me, and that Y fynde grace in thin iyen, that Y be not punyschid bi so grete yuelis.
16 And the Lord seide to Moises, Gadere thou to me seuenti men  of the eldre men of Israel, whiche thou knowist, `that thei ben the elde men and maistris of the puple; and thou schalt lede hem to the dore of the tabernacle of boond of pees, and thou schalt make to stonde there with thee,
17 that Y come doun, and speke to thee; and Y schal take awey of thi spirit, and Y schal yyue to hem, that thei susteyne with thee the birthun of the puple, and not thou aloone be greuyd.
18 And thou schalt seie to the puple, Be ye halewid; to morew ye schulen ete fleischis; for Y herde you seie, Who schal yyue to vs the metis of fleischis? it was wel to vs in Egipt; that the Lord yyue `fleischis to you,
19 and that ye ete not o dai, ethir tweyne, ethir fyue, ethir ten, sotheli nether twenti,
20 but `til to a monethe of daies, til it go out bi youre nosethirlis, and turne in to wlatyng; for ye han put awei the Lord, which is in the myddis of you, and ye wepten bifor hym, and seiden, Whi yeden we out of Egipt?
21 And Moises seide to the Lord, Sixe hundrid thousynde of foot men ben of this puple, and thou seist, Y schal yyue to hem `mete of fleischis an hool monethe.
22 Whether the multitude of scheep and of oxun schal be slayn, that it may suffice to mete, ethir alle the fischis of the see schulen be gaderid to gidere, that tho fille hem?
23 To whom the Lord answeride, Whether the `hond of the Lord is vnmyyti? riyt now thou schalt se, wher my word schal be fillid in werk.
24 Therfor Moises cam, and telde to the puple the wordis of the Lord; and he gaderide seuenti men of the eldere of Israel, whiche he made stonde aboute the tabernacle.
25 And the Lord cam doun bi a cloude, and spak to Moises, and took a weye of the spirit that was in Moises, and yaf to the seuenti men; and whanne  the spirit hadde restid in hem, thei profesieden, and ceessiden not `aftirward.
26 Forsothe twei men dwelliden stille in the tentis, of whiche men oon was clepid Heldad, and the tothir Medad, on whiche the spirit restide; for also thei weren descryued, and thei yeden not out to the tabernacle.
27 And whanne thei profesieden in the tentis, a child ran, and teld to Moises, and seide, Heldad and Medad profecien in the tentis.
28 Anoon Josue, the sone of Nun, the `mynystre of Moises, and chosun of manye, seide, My lord Moises, forbede thou hem.
29 And he seide, What hast thou enuye for me? who yyueth that al the puple profesie, and that God yyue his spirit to hem?
30 And Moises turnede ayen, and the eldre men in birthe of Israel in to the tentis.
31 Forsothe a wynde yede forth fro the Lord, and took curlewis, and bar ouer the see, and lefte in to the tentis, in the iurney, as myche as mai be parformed in o day, bi ech part of the tentis bi cumpas; and tho flowen in the eir bi twei cubitis in `hiynesse ouer the erthe.
32 Therfor the puple roos in al that dai and nyyt and in to the tothir dai, and gaderide the multitude of curlewis; he that gaderide litil, gaderide ten `mesuris clepid chorus; `and o chorus conteyneth ten buschels; and thei drieden tho curlewis bi the cumpas of the tentis.
33 Yit `fleischis weren in the teeth `of hem, and siche mete failide not; and lo! the woodnesse of the Lord was reisid ayens the puple, and smoot it with a ful greet veniaunce.
34 And thilke place was clepid The sepulcris of coueitise, for there thei birieden the puple that desiride fleischis. Sotheli thei yeden `out of the sepulcris of coueitise, and camen in to Asseroth, and dwelliden there.

CAP 12
1 And Marie spak and Aaron ayens Moises, for his wijf a womman of Ethiope,
2 and seiden, Whethir God spak oneli by Moises? whethir he spak not also to vs in lijk maner? And whanne the Lord hadde herd this, he was wrooth greetli;
3 for Moises was the myldest man, ouer alle men that dwelliden in erthe.
4 And anoon the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron and to Marye, Go out ye thre aloone to the tabernacle of boond of pees. And whanne thei weren gon yn,
5 the Lord cam doun in a piler of cloude, and he stood in the entryng of the tabernacle, and clepide Aaron and Marie.
6 And whanne thei hadden go, he seide to hem, Here ye my wordis; if ony among you is a profete of the Lord, Y schal appere to hym in reuelacioun, ethir Y schal speke to hym bi `a dreem.
7 And he seide, And my seruaunt Moises is not siche, which is moost feithful in al myn hows;
8 for Y speke to hym mouth to mouth, and he seeth God opynli, and not bi derke spechis and figuris. Why therfor dredden ye not to bacbite `ether depraue my seruaunt Moises?
9 And the Lord was wrooth ayens hem, and he wente a wei.
10 And the cloude yede awei, that was on the tabernacle and lo! Marie apperide whijt with lepre as snow. And whanne Aaron biheelde hir, and siy hir bispreynd with lepre,
11 he seide to Moises, My lord, Y beseche, putte thou not this synne on vs,
12 which we diden folili, that this womman be not maad as deed, and as a deed borun thing which is cast out of the `wombe of his modir; lo! now the half of hir fleisch is deuourid with lepre.
13 And Moises criede to the Lord, and seide, Lord, Y biseche, heele thou hir.
14 To whom the Lord answerid, If hir fadir hadde spet in  to hir face, where sche ouyte not to be fillid with schame, nameli in seuene daies? Therfor be sche departid out of the tentis bi seuen daies, and aftirward sche schal be clepid ayen.
15 And so Marie was excludid out of the tentis bi seuene daies; and the puple was not mouyd fro that place, til Marie was clepid ayen.

CAP 13
1 And the puple yede forth fro Asseroth, whanne the tentis weren set in the deseert of Pharan.
2 And there the Lord spak to Moises,
3 and seide, Sende thou men that schulen biholde the lond of Canaan, which Y schal yyue to the sones of Israel, of ech lynage o man of the princes.
4 Moises dide that that the Lord comaundide, and sente fro the deseert of Pharan princes, men of whiche these ben the names.
5 Of the lynage of Ruben, Semmya, the sone of Zectur.
6 Of the lynage of Symeon, Saphat, the sone of Hury.
7 Of the lynage of Juda, Caleph, the sone of Jephone.
8 Of the lynage of Isachar, Igal, the sone of Joseph.
9 Of the lynage of Effraym, Osee, the sone of Nun.
10 Of the lynage of Beniamyn, Phalti, the sone of Raphu.
11 Of the lynage of Zabulon, Gediel, the sone of Sodi.
12 Of the lynage of Joseph, of the gouernaunce of Manasses, Gaddi, the sone of Susy.
13 Of the lynage of Dan, Amyel, the sone of Gemalli.
14 Of the lynage of Aser, Sur, the sone of Mychael.
15 Of the lynage of Neptalym, Nabdi, the sone of Napsi.
16 Of the lynage of Gad, Guel, the sone of Machi.
17 These ben the names of men, which Moises sente to biholde the lond of Canaan; and he clepide Osee, the sone of Nun, Josue.
18 Therfor Moises sente hem to biholde the lond of Canaan, and seide to hem, `Stie ye bi the south coost; and whanne ye comen to the  hillis,
19 biholde ye the lond, what maner lond it is; and biholde ye the puple which is the dwellere therof, whether it is strong, ethir feble, `whether thei ben fewe in noumbre, ether manye;
20 whether that lond is good, ethir yuel; what maner citees ben, wallid, ether without wallis;
21 whether the lond is fat, ether bareyn, `whether it is ful of woodis, ethir without trees. Be ye coumfortid, and `brynge ye to vs of the fruytis of that lond. Sotheli the tyme was, whanne grapis first ripe myyten be etun thanne.
22 And whanne thei hadden stied, thei aspieden the lond, fro the deseert of Syn `til to Rohob, as men entryth to Emath.
23 And thei stieden to the south, and camen in to Ebron, where Achyman, and Sisai, and Tholmai, the sones of Enach, weren; for Hebron was maad bi seuen yeer bifor Thamnys, the citee of Egipt.
24 And thei yeden til to the stronde of clustre, and kittiden doun a sioun with his grape, which twei men baren in a barre; also thei token of pumgarnadis, and of the figis of that place which is clepid Nehelescol,
25 that is, the stronde of grape, for the sones of Israel baren a clustre fro thennus.
26 And the aspieris of the lond, whanne thei hadden cumpassid al the cuntrey, after fourti daies camen to Moises and Aaron,
27 and to al the cumpany of the sones of Israel, in to the deseert of Pharan which is in Cades. And `the aspieris spaken to hem, and schewiden the fruytis of the lond to al the multitude, and telden,
28 and seiden, We camen to the lond, to which thou sentest vs, which lond treuli flowith with mylk and hony, as it may be knowun bi these fruytis;
29 but it hath strongeste inhabiteris, and grete cytees, and wallid; we sien there the kynrede of Anachym;  Amalech dwellith in the south;
30 Ethei, and Jebusei, and Amorey dwellen in the hilli placis; forsothe Cananey dwellith bisidis the see, and bisidis the floodis of Jordan.
31 Among thes thingis Caleph peeside the grutchyng of the puple, that was maad ayens Moises, and seide, `Stie we, and welde we the lond, for we moun gete it.
32 Forsothe other aspieris, that weren with hym, seiden, We moun not stie to this puple, for it is strongere than we.
33 And thei deprauyden the lond which thei hadden biholde, anentis the sones of Israel, and seiden, The lond which we cumpassiden deuourith hise dwelleris; the puple which we bihelden is of large stature; there we syen summe wondris ayens kynde,
34 of the sones of Enach, of the kynde of geauntis, to whiche we weren comparisound, and weren seien as locustis.

CAP 14
1 Therfor al the cumpeny criede, and wepte in that nyyt,
2 and alle the sones of Israel grutchiden ayens Moises and Aaron, and seiden,
3 We wolden that we hadden be deed in Egipt, and not in this waast wildirnesse; we wolden that we perischen, and that the Lord lede vs not in to this lond, lest we fallen bi swerd, and oure wyues and fre children ben led prisoneris; whether it is not betere to turne ayen in to Egipt?
4 And thei seiden oon to another, Ordeyne we a duyk to vs, and turne we ayen in to Egipt.
5 And whanne this was herd, Moises and Aaron felden lowe to erthe, bifor al the multitude of the sones of Israel.
6 And sotheli Josue, the sone of Nun, and Caleph, the sone of Jephone, whiche also cumpassiden the lond, to renten her clothis,
7 and spaken to al the multitude of the  sones of Israel, The lond which we cumpassiden is ful good;
8 if the Lord is merciful to vs, he schal lede vs in to it, and schal yyue `to vs the lond flowynge with mylk and hony.
9 Nyle ye be rebel ayens the Lord, nether drede ye the puple of this lond, for we moun deuoure hem so as breed; al her help passide awei fro hem, the Lord is with vs, nyle ye drede.
10 And whanne al the multitude criede, and wolde oppresse hem with stonys, the glorie of the Lord apperide on the roof of the boond of pees, while alle the sones of Israel sien.
11 And the Lord seide to Moises, Hou long schal this puple bacbite me? Hou longe schulen thei not bileue to me in alle `signes, whiche Y haue do bifor hem?
12 Therfor Y schal smyte hem with pestilence, and Y schal waste hem; forsothe Y schal make thee prince on a greet folk, and strongere than is this.
13 And Moises seide to the Lord, Egipcians `here not, fro whos myddil thou leddist out this puple,
14 and the dwelleris of this loond, whiche herden that thou, Lord, art in this puple, and art seyn face to face, and that thi cloude defendith hem, and that thou goist bifore hem in a pilere of cloude bi dai,
15 and in a piler of fier bi nyyt, that thou hast slayn so greet a multitude as o man,
16 and seie thei, He myyte not brynge this puple in to the lond for whiche he swoor, therfor he killide hem in wildirnesse;
17 therfor the strengthe of the Lord be magnified, as thou hast swore. And Moises seide,
18 Lord pacient, and of myche mercy, doynge awei wickidnesse and trespassis, and leeuynge no man vngilti, which visitist the synnes of fadris in to sones in to the thridde and fourthe generacioun, Y biseche,
19 foryyue thou the synne of this thi puple, aftir the greetnesse of thi merci, as thou were merciful to men goynge  out of Egipt `til to this place.
20 And the Lord seide, Y haue foryouun to hem, bi thi word.
21 Y lyue; and the glorie of the Lord schal be fillid in al erthe;
22 netheles alle men that sien my mageste, and my signes, whiche Y dide in Egipt and in the wildirnesse, and temptiden me now bi ten sithis, and obeieden not to my vois,
23 schulen not se the lond for which Y swore to her fadris, nethir ony of hem that bacbitide me, schal se it.
24 Y schal lede my seruaunt Caleph, that was ful of anothir spirit, and suede me, in to this lond, which he cumpasside, and his seed schal welde it.
25 For Amalech and Cananei dwellen in the valeis, to morewe moue ye tentis, and turne ye ayen in to wildirnesse bi the weie of the reed see.
26 And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron, and seide,
27 Hou long grutchith this werste multitude ayens me? Y haue herd the pleyntis of the sones of Israel.
28 Therfor seie thou to hem, Y lyue, seith the Lord; as ye spaken while Y herde, so Y schal do to you;
29 youre careyns schulen ligge in this wildirnesse. Alle ye that ben noumbrid, fro twenti yeer and aboue, and grutchiden ayens me,
30 schulen not entre in to the lond, on which Y reiside myn hond, that Y schulde make you to dwelle outakun Caleph, the sone of Jephone, and Josue, the sone of Nun.
31 Forsothe Y schal lede in youre litle children, of whiche ye seiden that thei schulden be preyes `ethir raueyns to enemyes, that thei se the lond which displeside you.
32 Forsothe youre careyns schulen ligge in the wildirnesse;
33 youre sones schulen be walkeris aboute in the deseert bi fourti yeer, and thei schulen bere youre fornycacioun, til the careyns of the fadris ben wastid in the deseert,
34 by the noumbre of fourti daies, in whiche ye  bihelden the loond; a yeer schal be arettid for a dai, and bi fourti yeer ye schulen resseyue youre wickidnesse, and ye schulen knowe my veniaunce.
35 For as Y spak, so Y schal do to al this werste multitude, that roos to gidere ayens me; it schal faile, and schal die in this wildirnesse.
36 Therfor alle the men whyche Moises hadde sent to see the lond, and whiche turniden ayen, and maden al the multitude to grutche ayens hym, and depraueden the lond, that it was yuel,
37 weren deed, and smytun in the siyt of the Lord.
38 Sotheli Josue, the sone of Nun, and Caleph, the sone of Jephone, lyueden, of alle men that yeden to se the lond.
39 And Moises spak alle these wordis to alle the sones of Israel, and the puple mourenyde gretli.
40 And, lo! thei riseden in the morewtid first, and `stieden in to the cop of the hil, and seiden, We ben redi to stie to the place, of which the Lord spak, for we synneden.
41 To whiche Moises seide, Whi passen ye the word of the Lord, that schal not bifalle to you in to prosperite?
42 Nyle ye stie, for the Lord is not with you, lest ye fallen bifor youre enemyes.
43 Amalech and Cananei ben bifor you, bi the swerd of whiche ye schulen falle, for ye nolden assente to the Lord, nether the Lord schal be with you.
44 And thei weren maad derk, and stieden in to the cop of the hil; forsothe the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moises yeden not awey fro the tentis.
45 And Amalech cam doun, and Chananei, that dwelliden in the hil, and he smoot hem, and kittide doun, and pursuede hem til Horma.

CAP 15
1 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
2 and thou schalt seie to hem, Whanne ye han entrid in to the lond of youre abitacioun which Y schal yyue to you,
3 and ye make an offryng to the Lord in to brent sacrifice, ether a pesible sacrifice, and ye payen auowis, ethir offren yiftis bi fre wille, ethir in youre solempnytees ye brennen odour of swetnesse to the Lord, of oxun, ether of scheep;
4 who euer offrith the slayn sacrifice, schal offre a sacrifice of flour, the tenthe part of ephi, spreynt togidere with oile, which oil schal haue a mesure the fourthe part of hyn;
5 and he schal yyue wyn to fletynge sacrifices to be sched, of the same mesure, in to brent sacrifice, and slayn sacrifice.
6 Bi ech loomb and ram schal be the sacrifice of flour, of twey tenthe partis, which schal be spreynt togidere with oile, of the thridde part of hyn;
7 and he schal offre wyn to the fletynge sacrifice, of the thridde part of the same mesure, in to odour of swetnesse to the Lord.
8 Forsothe whanne thou makist a brent sacrifice, ethir an offryng of oxun, that thou fille avow, ethir pesible sacrifice, thou schalt yyue,
9 bi ech oxe, thre tenthe partis of flour, spreynt togidere with oile, which schal haue the half of mesure of hyn;
10 and thou schalt yyue wyn to fletynge sacrifices to be sched, of the same mesure, in to offryng of the swettest odour to the Lord.
11 So ye schulen do bi ech oxe, and ram,
12 and lomb, and kide;
13 as wel men borun in the lond,
14 as pilgrymys, schulen offre sacrifices bi the same custom;
15 o comaundement and doom schal be, as wel to you as to comelyngis of the lond.
16 And the Lord spak to Moises,
17 and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt  seie to hem,
18 Whanne ye comen in to the lond which Y schal yyue to you,
19 and `ye eten of the looues of that cuntrey, ye
20 schulen departe the firste fruytis of youre metis to the Lord; as ye schulen departe the firste fruytis of corn flooris,
21 so ye schulen yyue the firste fruytis also of sewis to the Lord.
22 That if bi ignoraunce ye passen ony of tho thingis whiche the Lord spak to Moyses,
23 and comaundide bi hym to you, fro the dai in which he bigan to comaunde,
24 and ouer, and the multitude hath foryete to do, it schal offre a calf of the drooue, brent sacrifice in to swettist odour to the Lord, and the sacrificis therof, and fletynge offryngis, as the cerymonyes therof axen; and it schal offre a `buc of geet for synne.
25 And the preest schal preie for al the multitude of the sones of Israel, and it schal be foryouun to hem, for thei synneden not wilfuli. And neuerthelesse thei schulen offre encense to the Lord for hemsilf, and for her synne and errour;
26 and it schal be foryouun to al the puple of the sones of Israel, and to comelyngis that ben pilgryms among hem, for it is the synne of al the multitude bi ignoraunce.
27 That if a soule synneth vnwityngli, it schal offre a geet of o yeer for his synne; and the preest schal preye for that soule, for it synnede vnwityngli bifor the Lord;
28 and the preest schal gete foryyuenesse to it, and synne schal be foryouun to it.
29 As wel to men borun in the lond as to comelyngis, o lawe schal be of alle that synnen vnwityngli.
30 Forsothe a man that doith ony synne bi pride, schal perische fro his puple, whether he be a citeseyn, ethir a pilgrym, for he was rebel ayens the Lord;
31 for he dispiside the word of the Lord, and made voide his comaundement; therfor he schal be doon awei, and schal bere his owne wickidnes.
32 Forsothe it was doon, whanne the  sones of Israel weren in wildirnesse, and hadde founde a man gaderynge woode in the `day of sabat,
33 thei brouyten hym to Moises, and to Aaron, and to al the multitude; whiche closiden hym in to prisoun,
34 and wisten not what thei schulden do of hym.
35 And the Lord seide to Moises, This man die bi deeth; al the cumpeny oppresse hym with stoonus with out the tentis.
36 And whanne thei hadden led hym with out forth, thei oppressiden him with stoonus, and he was deed, as the Lord comaundide.
37 Also the Lord seide to Moises,
38 Speke thou to the sones of Israel, and thou schalt seye to hem, that thei make to hem hemmes bi foure corneris of mentils, and sette laces of iacynct `in tho;
39 and whanne thei seen thoo, haue thei mynde of alle comaundementis of the Lord, lest thei suen her thouytis and iyen, doynge fornycacioun bi dyuerse thingis;
40 but more be thei myndeful of the `Lordis heestis, and do thei tho, and be thei hooli to her God.
41 Y am youre Lord God, which ledde you out of the lond of Egipt, that Y schulde be youre God.

CAP 16
1 Lo! forsothe Chore, the sone of Isuar, sone of Caath, sone of Leuy, and Dathan and Abiron, the sones of Heliab, and Hon, the sone of Pheleph, of the sones of Ruben, rysen ayens Moises,
2 and othere of the sones of Israel, two hundryd men and fifti, prynces of the synagoge, and whiche weren clepid bi names in the tyme of counsel.
3 And whanne `thei hadden stonde ayens Moises and Aaron, thei seiden, Suffice it to you, for al the multitude is of hooly men, and the Lord is in hem; whi ben ye reisid on the puple of the Lord?
4 And whanne Moises hadde herd this, he felde lowe on the face.
5 And he spak  to Chore, and to al the multitude; he seide, Eerli the Lord schal make knowun whiche perteynen to hym, and he schal applie to hym hooli men; and thei whiche he hath chose, schulen neiye to hym.
6 Therfor do ye this thing; ech man take his cencere, thou Chore, and al thi counsel;
7 and to morewe whanne fier is takun vp, putte ye encense aboue bifor the Lord, and whom euer the Lord chesith, he schal be hooli. Ye sones of Leuy ben myche reisid.
8 And eft Moises seide to Chore, Ye sones of Leuy, here.
9 Whether it is litil to you, that God of Israel departide you fro al the puple, and ioynede you to hym silf, that ye schulden serue hym in the seruyce of tabernacle, and that ye schulden stonde bifor the multitude of puple, and schulden serue hym?
10 Made he therfor thee and alle thi bretheren the sones of Leuy to neiy to hym silf, that ye chalenge to you also preesthod,
11 and al thi gaderyng togidere stonde ayens the Lord? For whi what is Aaron, that ye grutchen ayens hym?
12 Therfor Moises sente to clepe Dathan and Abiron, the sones of Heliab; whiche answeriden, We comen not.
13 Whethir is it litil to thee, that thou leddist vs out of the lond that flowide with mylk and hony, to sle vs in the deseert, no but also thou be lord of vs?
14 Verili thou hast bronyt vs in to the lond that flowith with streemys of mylk and hony, and hast youe to vs possessioun of feeldis, and of vyneris; whethir also thou wolt putte out oure iyen?
15 We comen not. And Moises was wrooth greetli, and seide to the Lord, Biholde thou not the sacrifices of hem; thou wost that Y took neuere of hem, yhe, a litil asse, nethir Y turmentide ony of hem.
16 And Moises seide to Chore, Thou and al thi congregacioun stonde asidis half bifor the Lord, and Aaron to  morewe bi hym silf.
17 Take ye alle bi you silf youre censeris, and putte ye encense in tho, and offre ye to the Lord, tweyn hundrid and fifti censeris; and Aaron holde his censer.
18 And whanne thei hadden do this, while Moises and Aaron stoden,
19 and thei hadden gaderid al the multitude to the `dore of the tabernacle ayens hem, the glorie of the Lord apperide to alle.
20 And the Lord spak to Moises and Aaron,
21 and seide, Be ye departid fro the myddis of this congregacioun, that Y leese hem sodeynli.
22 Whiche felden lowe on the face, and seiden, Strongeste God of the spiritis of al fleisch, whethir `thin yre schal be fers ayens alle men, for o man synneth?
23 And the Lord seide to Moises,
24 Comaunde thou to al the puple, that it be departid fro the tabernaclis of Chore, and of Dathan, and of Abiron.
25 And Moises roos, and yede to Dathan and Abiron; and while the eldre men of Israel sueden hym,
26 he seide to the cumpeny, Go ye awey fro the tabernaclis of wickid men, and nyle ye touche tho thingis that parteynen to hem, lest ye ben wlappid in the synnes of hem.
27 And whanne thei hadden gon awei fro the tentis `of hem bi the cumpas, Dathan and Abiron yeden out, and stoden in the entryng of her tentis, with wyues, and fre children, and al the multitude.
28 And Moises seide, In this ye schulen wite that the Lord sente me, that Y schulde do alle thingis whiche ye seen, and Y brouyte not forth tho of myn owne herte.
29 If thei perischen bi customable deeth of men, and wounde visite hem, bi which also othere men ben wont to be visitid,
30 the Lord sente not me; but if the Lord doith a newe thing, that the erthe opene his mouth, and swolewe hem,  and alle thingis that perteynen to hem, and thei goen doun quyke in to helle, ye schulen wite that thei blasfemeden the Lord.
31 Therfor anoon as he cesside to speke, the erthe was brokun vndur her feet,
32 and the erthe openyde his mouth, and deuowride hem, with her tabernaclis, and al the catel `of hem;
33 and thei yeden doun quike in to helle, and weren hilid with erthe, and perischiden fro the myddis of the multitude.
34 And sotheli al Israel that stood bi the cumpas, fledde fro the cry of men perischinge, and seide, Lest perauenture the erthe swolewe also vs.
35 But also fier yede out fro the Lord, and killide tweyn hundrid and fifti men that offriden encense.
36 And the Lord spak to Moises, and seide,
37 Comaunde thou to Eleasar, sone of Aaron, preest, that he take the censeris that liggen in the brennyng, and that he schatere the fier hidur and thidur; for tho ben halewid in the dethis of synneris;
38 and that he bringe forth tho in to platis, and naile to the auter, for encense is offrid in tho to the Lord, and tho ben halewid, that the sonis of Israel se tho for a signe and memorial.
39 Therfor Eleazar, preest, took the brasun senseris, in whiche censeris thei whiche the brennyng deuouride hadden offrid, and he `brouyt forth tho in to platis, and nailide to the auter;
40 that the sones of Israel schulden haue thingis aftirward, bi whiche thei schulden remembre, lest ony alien, and which is not of the seed of Aaron, neiy to offre encense to the Lord, lest he suffre, as Chore sufferide, and al his multitude, while the Lord spak to Moises.
41 Forsothe al the multitude of the sones of Israel grutchide in the dai suynge ayens Moises and Aaron, and seide, Ye han slayn the puple of the Lord.
42 And whanne discensioun  roos,
43 and noise encresside, Moises and Aaron fledden to the tabernacle of the boond of pees; and aftir that thei entriden in to it, a cloude hilide the tabernacle, and the glorie of the Lord apperide.
44 And the Lord seide to Moises and to Aaron,
45 Go ye awey fro the myddis of this multitude, also now Y schal do awey hem. And whanne thei laien in the erthe, Moises seide to Aaron,
46 Take the censer, and whanne fyer is takun vp of the auter, caste encense aboue, and go soone to the puple, that thou preye for hem; for now ire is gon out fro the Lord, and the wounde is feers.
47 And whanne Aaron hadde do this, and hadde runne to the myddis of the multitude, which the brennynge wastid thanne, he offeride encense;
48 and he stood bytwixe the deed men and lyuynge, and bisouyte for the puple, and the wounde ceesside.
49 Sotheli thei that weren smytun weren fourtene thousynde of men and seuene hundrid, with outen hem that perischiden in the discencioun of Chore.
50 And Aaron turnyde ayen to Moyses, to the dore of the tabernacle of boond of pees, aftir that the perischyng restide.

CAP 17
1 And the Lord spak to Moises, `and seide, Speke thou to the sones of Israel,
2 and take thou yerdis, bi her kynredis, bi ech kynrede o yeerde, take thou of alle the princes of the lynagis twelue yerdis; and thou schalt write the name of each lynage aboue his yerde;
3 forsothe the name of Aaron schal be in the lynage of Leuy, and o yerde schal conteyne alle the meynees of hem.
4 And thou schalt putte tho yerdis in the tabernacle of boond of pees, bifor the witnessyng, where Y schal speke to  thee; the yerde of hym schal buriowne, whom Y schal chese of hem;
5 and Y schal refreyne fro me the playnyngis of the sones of Israel, bi whiche thei grutchen ayens you.
6 And Moyses spak to the sones of Israel; and alle princes yauen to hym yerdis, bi alle lynagis; and the yerdis weren twelue, without the yerde of Aaron.
7 And whanne Moises hadde put tho yerdis bifor the Lord, in the tabernacle of witnessyng, he yede ayen in the day suynge,
8 and founde that the yerde of Aaron, `in the hows of Leuy, buriounnede; and whanne knoppis weren greet, the blossoms `hadden broke out, whiche weren alargid in leeuys, and weren fourmed in to alemaundis.
9 Therfor Moyses brouyte forth alle the yerdis fro the siyt of the Lord to al the sones of Israel; and thei sien, and resseyueden ech his yerde.
10 And the Lord seide to Moises, Bere ayen the yerde of Aaron in to the tabernacle of witnessyng, that it be kept there in to `the signe of the rebel sones of Israel, and that her `playntis reste fro me, lest thei dien.
11 And Moises dide, as the Lord comaundide.
12 Forsothe the sones of Israel seiden to Moises, Lo! we ben wastid, alle we perischiden;
13 who euer neiyeth to the tabernacle of the Lord, he dieth; whethir we schulen be doon awei alle `til to deeth?

CAP 18
1 And the Lord seide to Aaron, Thou, and thi sones, and the hows of thi fadir with thee, schulen bere the wickidnesse of the seyntuarie; and thou and thi sones togidere schulen suffre the synnes of youre preesthod.
2 But also take thou with thee  thi britheren of the lynage of Leuy, and the power of thi fadir, and be thei redi, that thei mynystre to thee. Forsothe thou and thi sones schulen mynystre in the tabernacle of witnessyng;
3 and the dekenes schulen wake at thi comaundementis, and at alle werkis of the tabernacle; so oneli that thei neiye not to the vessels of seyntuarie, and to the autir, lest bothe thei dien, and ye perischen togidere.
4 Forsothe be thei with thee, and wake thei in the kepyngis of the tabernacle, and in alle the cerymonyes therof. An alien schal not be meddlid with you.
5 Wake ye in the kepyng of the seyntuarie, and in the seruyce of the auter, lest indignacioun rise on the sones of Israel.
6 Lo! Y haue youun `to you youre britheren, dekenes, fro the myddis of the sones of Israel, and Y haue youe a fre yifte to the Lord, that thei serue in the seruyces of his tabernacle.
7 Forsothe thou and thi sones, kepe youre preesthod; and alle thingis that perteynen to the ournyng of the auter, and ben with ynne the veil, schulen be mynystrid bi preestis; if ony straunger neiyeth, he schal be slayn.
8 The Lord spak to Aaron, Lo! Y haue youe to thee the kepyng of my firste fruytis; Y haue youe to thee and to thi sones alle thingis, that ben halewid of the sones of Israel, for preestis office euerlastynge lawful thingis.
9 Therfor thou schalt take these thingis of tho thingis that ben halewid, and ben offrid to the Lord; ech offryng, and sacrifice, and what euer thing is yoldun to me for synne and for trespas, and cometh in to hooli of hooli thingis, schal be thin and thi sones.
10 Thou schalt ete it in the seyntuarie; malis oneli schulen ete therof, for it is halewid to the Lord.
11 Forsothe Y haue youe to thee, and to thi sones and douytris, bi euerlastynge riyt, the firste fruytis  whiche the sones of Israel a vowen and offren; he that is clene in thin hous, schal ete tho.
12 Y yaf to thee al the merowe of oile, and of wyn, and of wheete, what euer thing of the firste fruytis thei schulen offre to the Lord.
13 Alle the bigynnyngis of fruytis whiche the erthe bryngith forth, and ben brouyt to the Lord, schulen falle in to thin vsis; he that is cleene in thin hous, schal ete of tho.
14 Al thing which the sones of Israel yelden bi avow, schal be thin.
15 What euer thing `schal breke out first of the wombe of al fleisch, which fleisch thei offren to the Lord, whether it is of men, ethir of beestis, it schal be of thi riyt; so oneli that thou take prijs for the firste gendrid child of man, and that thou make ech beeste which is vncleene to be bouyt ayen;
16 whos ayenbiyng schal be aftir o monethe, for fyue siclis of siluer, bi the weiyte of seyntuarie; a sicle hath xx. halpens.
17 Forsothe thou schalt not make the firste gendrid of oxe, and of scheep, and of goet, to be ayen bouyt, for tho ben halewid to the Lord; oneli thou schalt schede the blood of tho on the auter, and thou schalt brenne the ynnere fatnesse in to swettist odour to the Lord.
18 Forsothe the fleischis schulen falle in to thin vss, as the brest halewid and the riyt schuldur, schulen be thine.
19 Y yaf to the and to thi sones and douytris, bi euerlastynge riyt, alle the firste fruytis of seyntuarie, whiche the sones of Israel offren to the Lord; it is euerlastynge couenant of salt bifor the Lord, to thee, and to thi sones.
20 And the Lord seide to Aaron, Ye schulen not welde ony thing in the lond of hem, nether ye schulen haue part among hem; Y am thi part and erytage, in the myddis of the  sones of Israel.
21 Forsothe Y yaf to the sones of Leuy alle the tithis of Israel in to possessioun, for the seruyce bi whyche thei seruen me in the tabernacle of boond of pees;
22 that the sones of Israel neiye no more to the `tabernacle of boond of pees, nether do dedli synne.
23 To the sones aloone of Leuy, seruynge me in the tabernacle, and berynge the `synnes of the puple, it schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge in youre generaciouns.
24 Thei schulen welde noon other thing, and thei schulen be apeied with the offryng of tithis, whiche Y departide in to vsis and necessaries of hem.
25 And the Lord spak to Moises and seide,
26 Comaunde thou, and denounse to the dekenes, Whanne ye han take tithis of the sones of Israel, whiche Y yaf to you, offre ye the firste fruytis of tho to the Lord, that is, the tenthe part of the dyme,
27 that it be arettid to you in to offryng of the firste fruytis, as wel of corn flooris as of pressis;
28 and of alle thingis of whiche ye taken tithis, offre ye the firste fruytis to the Lord, and yyue ye to Aaron, preest.
29 Alle thingis whiche ye schulen offre of tithis, and schulen departe in to the yiftis of the Lord, schulen be the beste, and alle chosun thingis.
30 And thou schalt seye to hem, If ye offren to the Lord alle the clere and betere thingis of tithis, it schal be arettid to you, as if ye yauen the firste fruitis of the corn floor and presse.
31 And ye schulen ete tho tithis in alle youre placis, as wel ye as youre meynees, for it is the prijs for the seruyce, in whiche ye seruen in the tabernacle of witnessyng.
32 And ye schulen not do synne on this thing, `and resserue noble thingis and fat to you, lest ye defoulen the offryngis of the sones of Israel, and ye dien.

CAP 19
1 And the Lord spak to Moises and to Aaron,
2 and seide, This is the religioun of sacrifice, which the Lord ordeynede. Comaunde thou to the sones of Israel, that thei brynge to thee a reed cow of hool age, in which is no wem, nether sche hath bore yok.
3 And ye schulen bitake hir to Eleazar, preest, which schal offre `the cow, led out of the tentis, in the siyt of alle men.
4 And he schal dippe his fyngur in the blood therof, and schal sprynge seuene sithis ayens the yatis of the tabernacle.
5 And he schal brenne that cow, while alle men sien; and he schal yyue as wel the skyn and fleischis therof as the blood and dung to flawme.
6 Also the preest schal `sende a tre of cedre, and ysope, and reed threed died twies, into the flawme that deuourith the cow.
7 And thanne at the laste, whanne hise clothis `and bodi ben waischun, he schal entre in to the tentis, and he schal be defoulid `til to euentid.
8 But also he that brente the cow, schal waische hise clothis, and bodi, and he schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
9 Forsothe a cleene man schal gadere the aischis of the cow, and schal schede out tho with out the tentis, in a place moost cleene, that tho be to the multitude of the sones of Israel in to keping, and in to watir of spryngyng; for the cow is brent for synne.
10 And whanne he that bar the aischis of the cow, hath waische hise clothis, he schal be vncleene `til to euentid. And the sones of Israel, and comelyngis that dwellen among hem, schulen haue this hooli bi euerlastynge lawe.
11 He that touchith a deed bodi of man, and is vncleene for this bi seuene  daies,
12 schal be spreynt of this watir in the thridde, and in the seuenthe dai; and so he schal be clensid. If he is not spreynt in the thridde dai, he schal not mow be clensid in the seuenthe dai.
13 Ech that touchith the deed bodi bi it silf of mannus soule, and is not spreynt with this medlyng, defoulith the `tabernacle of the Lord, and he schal perische fro Israel; for he is not spreynt with the wateris of clensyng, he schal be vncleene, and his filthe schal dwelle on hym.
14 This is the lawe of a man that dieth in the tabernacle; alle that entren in to his tente, and alle vessels that ben there, schulen be defoulid bi seuene daies.
15 A vessel that hath not an hilyng, nethir a byndyng aboue, schal be vncleene.
16 If ony man touchith the deed bodi of man slayn in the feeld, ether deed bi hym silf, ether a boon, ether the sepulcre `of hym, he schal be vncleene bi seuene daies.
17 And thei schulen take `of the aischis of the brennyng, and of the synne, and thei schulen sende quyk watris in to a vessel on tho aischis;
18 in whiche whanne `a cleene man hath dippid ysope, he schal spreynge therof the tente, and al the purtenaunce of howshold, and men defoulid bi sich defoulyng.
19 And in this maner a cleene man schal clense an vncleene, in the thridde and in the seuenthe dai; and he schal be clensid in the seuenthe dai. And he schal waische hym silf, and hise clothis, and he schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
20 If ony man is not clensid bi this custom, the soule of hym schal perische fro the myddis of the chirche; for he defoulith the `seyntuarie of the Lord, and is not spreynt with the watir of clensyng.
21 This comaundement  schal be a lawful thing euerlastynge. Also he that schal sprenge the watris schal waische his clothis; ech man that touchith the watris of clensyng, schal be vncleene `til to euentid.
22 What euer thing an vncleene man touchith, he schal make it vncleene; and a soule that touchith ony of these thingis `defoulid so, schal be vncleene `til to euentid.

CAP 20
1 And the sones of Israel and al the multitude camen in to the deseert of Syn, in the firste monethe. And the puple dwellide in Cades; and Marie was deed there, and biried in the same place.
2 And whanne the puple hadde nede to watir, thei yeden togidere ayens Moises and Aaron; and thei weren turned in to dissensioun,
3 and seiden, We wolden that we hadden perischid among oure britheren bifor the Lord.
4 Whi han ye led out the chirche of the Lord in to wildirnesse, that bothe we and oure beestis die?
5 Whi han ye maad vs to stie from Egipt, and han brouyt vs in to this werste place, which may not be sowun, which nether bryngith forth fige tre, nether vineris, nether pumgranatis, ferthermore and hath not watir to drynke?
6 And whanne the multitude was left, Moises and Aaron entriden in to the tabernacle of boond of pees, and felden lowe to erthe, and crieden to God, and seiden, Lord God, here the cry of this puple, and opene to hem thi tresour, a welle of quyk watir, that whanne thei ben fillid, the grutchyng of hem ceesse. And the glorie of the Lord apperide on hem;
7 and the Lord spak to Moises,
8 and seide, Take the yerde, and gadere the puple, thou, and Aaron thi brother; and speke ye to the stoon bifore hem, and it schal yyue watris. And whanne thou hast led watir  out of the stoon, al the multitude schal drynke, and the beestis therof `schulden drynke.
9 Therfor Moises took the yerde that was in the `siyt of the Lord, as the Lord comaundide to hym,
10 whanne the multitude was gaderid bifor the stoon; and he seide to hem, Here ye, rebel and vnbileueful; whether we moun brynge out of this stoon watir to you?
11 And whanne Moises hadde reisid the hond, and hadde smyte the flynt twies with the yerde, largeste watris yeden out, so that the puple drank, and the beestis drunken.
12 And the Lord seide to Moises and to Aaron, For ye bileueden not to me, that ye schulden halewe me bifor the sones of Israel, ye schulen not lede these puples in to the lond which Y schal yyue to hem.
13 This is the watir of ayenseiyng; there the sones of Israel stryueden ayens the Lord, and he was halewid in hem.
14 In the meene tyme Moises sente messangeres fro Cades to the kyng of Edom, whiche seiden, Israel thi brother sendith these thinges. Thou knowist al the trauel that took vs,
15 hou oure fadris yeden doun in to Egipt, and we dwelliden there myche tyme, and Egipcians turmentiden vs and oure fadris; and hou we crieden to the Lord,
16 and he herde vs, and sente an aungel that ledde vs out of Egipt. And lo! we ben set in the citee of Cades, which is in thi laste coostis,
17 and we bisechen that it be leueful to vs to passe thorou thi lond; we schulen not go bi feeldis, nether bi vyneris, nether we schulen drynke watris of thi pittis; but we schulen go in the comyn weie, and we schulen not bowe to the riyt side, nether to the left side, til we passen thi termes.
18 To whom Edom answeride, Ye schulen not passe bi me, ellis Y schal be armed, and come ayens thee.
19 And the  sones of Israel seiden, We schulen go bi the weie comynli vsid, and if we and oure beestis drynken thi watris, we schulen yyue that that is iust; noon hardnesse schal be in prijs, onely passe we swiftli.
20 And he answeride, Ye schulen not passe. And anoon he yede out ayens Israel, with a multitude without noumbre, and `strong hond,
21 nether he wolde assente to Israel bisechynge, that he schulde graunte passage bi hise coostis. Wherfor Israel turnede awey fro hym.
22 And whanne thei hadden moued tentis fro Cades, thei camen in to the hil of Hor, which is in the endis of the lond of Edom;
23 where the Lord spak to Moyses and seide, Aaron go to his puples;
24 for he schal not entre in to the lond which Y yaf to the sones of Israel, for he was vnbileueful to my mouth, at the watris of ayenseiyng.
25 Take thou Aaron, and his sone with hym, and thou schalt lede hem in to the hil of Hor;
26 and whanne thou hast maad nakid the fadir of his cloth, thou schalt clothe `with it Eleazar, his sone, and Aaron schal be gederid, and schal die there.
27 Moises dide as the Lord comaundide; and thei stieden in to the hil of Hor, bifor al the multitude.
28 And whanne he hadde maad nakid Aaron of hise clothis, he clothide with tho Eleazar, his sone.
29 Sotheli whanne Aaron was deed in the `cop of the hil, Moises cam doun with Eleazar.
30 Sotheli al the multitude siy that Aaron was deed, and wepte on hym thretti daies, bi alle her meyness.

1 And whanne Chananei, the kyng of Arad, that dwellide at the south, hadde herd this, that is, that Israel cam bi the weye of aspieris, he fauyt ayens hem; and Chananei was ouercomere and ledde pray of Israel.
2 And Israel bounde hym sylf bi avow to the Lord, and seide, If thou schalt  bitake this puple in myn hond, Y schal do awei `the citees therof.
3 And the Lord herde the preieris of Israel, and bitook the Chananey; and Israel killid hym, and distruyede hise citees; and clepide the name of that place Horma, that is, cursyng, `ethir hangyng up.
4 `Forsothe thei yeden forth also fro the hil of Hor, bi the weie that ledith to the reed see, that thei schulden cumpasse the lond of Edom; and it bigan to anoye the puple, of the weie and trauel.
5 And the puple spak ayens the Lord and Moises, and seide, Whi leddist thou vs out of Egipt, that we schulden die in wildirnesse? breed failith, watris ben not; oure soule wlatith now on this `meete moost liyt.
6 Wherfor the Lord sente `firid serpentis in to the puple; at the woundis of whiche serpentis, and the dethis of ful many men,
7 thei camen to Moyses, and seiden, We synneden, for we spaken ayens the Lord and thee; preie thou, that he take awey fro vs the serpentis.
8 And Moises preiede for the puple; and the Lord seide to hym, Make thou a serpent of bras, and sette thou it for a signe; he that is smytun and biholdith it, schal lyue.
9 Therfor Moyses made a serpent of bras, and settide for a signe; and men smytun and biholdynge it, weren heelid.
10 And the sones of Israel yeden forth,
11 and settiden tentis in Oboth; fro whennus thei yeden forth, and settiden tentis in Neabarym, in the wildirnesse, that biholdith Moab, ayens the eest coost.
12 And thei moueden fro thennus, and camen to the stronde of Zareth;
13 which thei leften, and settiden tentis ayens Arnon, which is in the deseert, and apperith in the coostis of Amorrei. Forsothe Arnon is the terme of Moab, and departith Moabitis and Ammoreis.
14 Wherfor it is seid in the book of batels of the Lord, As he dide in the  reed see, so he schal do in the strondis of Arnon;
15 the harde rochis of the strondis weren bowid, that tho schulen reste in Arnon, and schulden ligge in the coostis of Moabitis.
16 Fro that place the pit apperide, of which the Lord spak to Moyses, Gadere thou the puple, and Y schal yyue watir to it.
17 Thanne Israel soong this song, The pit stie;
18 thei sungen togidere, The pit which the princes diggiden, and the duykis of the multitude maden redi, in the yyuere of the lawe, and in her stauys. And thei yeden forth fro the wildirnesse to Mathana,
19 fro Mathana to Naaliel, fro Naaliel in to Bamoth;
20 Bamoth is a valey in the cuntrey of Moab, in the cop of Phasga, that biholdith ayens the deseert.
21 Forsothe Israel sente messangeris to Seon, kyng of Ammorreis, and seide,
22 Y biseche that it be leueful to me to passe thorou thi loond; we schulen not bowe in to the feeldis and vyneris; we schulen not drynke watris of pittis; we schulen go in the kyngis weie, til we passen thi termes.
23 Which nolde graunte that Israel schulde passe thury hise coostis, but rather, whanne the oost was gaderid, he yede out ayens Israel, in to deseert. And he cam in to Yasa, and fauyt ayens Israel;
24 of whom he was smytun in the scharpnesse of swerd, and his lond was weldid fro Arnon `til to Jeboth and `the sones of Amon; for the termes of Amonytis weren holdun bi strong help.
25 Therfor Israel took alle `the citees of hym, and dwelliden in the citees of Amorrei, that is, in Esebon, and hise townes.
26 The citee of Esebon was Seons, kyng of Ammorei, which Seon fauyt ayens the kyng of Moab, and took al the lond that was of his lordschip, `til to Arnon.
27 Therfor  it is seid in prouerbe, Come ye in to Esebon, be it bildid, and maad the citee of Seon;
28 fier yede out of Esebon, flawme yede out of the citee `ethir greet castel of Seon, and deuouryde Ar of Moabitis, and the dwelleris of the `hiye places of Arnon.
29 Moab, wo to thee! thou, puple of Chamos, perischidist; it yaf the sones therof in to fliyt, and the douytris in to caitifte to Seon, kyng of Ammoreis;
30 the yok of hem perischide, fro Esebon `til to Dibon; the wery men camen in to Jophe, and `til to Medaba.
31 And so Israel dwellide in the lond of Ammorrey.
32 And Moises sente men that schulden aspie Jaser, whos `townes thei token, and weldiden the dwelleris.
33 And thei turniden hem silf, and stieden bi the weie of Basan. And Og, the kyng of Basan, with al his puple cam ayens hem, to fiyte in Edray.
34 And the Lord seide to Moises, Drede thou not hym, for Y haue bitake hym, and al his loond, and puple, in thin hoond; and thou schalt do to hym as thou didist to Seon, kyng of Ammorreis, the dwellere of Esebon.
35 Therfor thei smytiden `bothe hym with hise sones and al his puple, `til to deeth; and thei weldiden `the lond of hym.

CAP 22
1 And thei yeden forth, and settiden tentis in the feeldi places of Moab, where Jerico is set ouer Jordan.
2 Forsothe Balach, the sone of Sephor, siy alle thingis whiche Israel hadde do to Ammorrei,
3 and that men of Moab `hadden dred Israel, and miyten not bere the assailing of him.
4 And he seide to the grettere men in  birthe of Madian, So this puple schal do a wei alle men that dwellen in oure coostis, as an oxe is wont to do awei an eerbe `til to the rootis. Forsothe he, `that is, Balaac, was kyng in that tyme in Moab.
5 Therfor he sente messangeris to Balaam, the sone of Beor, a fals diuynour, that dwellide on the flood of the lond of the sones of Amon, that thei schulden clepe hym, and schulden seie, Lo! a puple yede out of Egipt, `which puple hilide the face of erthe, and sittith ayens me.
6 Therfor come thou, and curse this puple, which is strongere than Y, if in ony maner Y may smyte and dryue hym out of my lond; for Y knowe, that he is blissid whom thou blissist, and he is cursid whom thou hast cursid.
7 The eldere men of Moab and the grettere men in birthe of Madian yeden forth, hauynge in hondis the prijs of fals dyuynyng; and whanne thei hadden come to Balaam, and hadden teld to hym alle the wordis of Balaach, he answeride,
8 Dwelle ye here to nyyt, and Y schal answere what euer thing the Lord schal seie to me. Sotheli while thei dwelliden at Balaam, God cam, and seide to hym,
9 What wolen these men at thee `to hem silf?
10 Balaam answeride, Balaach, the sone of Sephor, kyng of Moabitis, sente to me, and seide, Lo!
11 a puple which is gon out of Egipt hilide the face of erthe; come thou, and curse hem, if in ony maner Y may fiyte, and dryue hym awey.
12 And God seide to Balaam, Nyle thou go with hem, nether curse thou the puple, for it is blessid.
13 Which Balaam roos eerli, and seide to the princes, Go ye in to youre lond, for God forbeed me to come with you.
14 The princes turneden ayen, and seiden to Balaach, Balaam nolde come with vs.
15 Eft Balaach sente many mo and noblere men, than he hadde sent  bifore;
16 whiche seiden, whanne thei hadden come to Balaam, Balaach, the sone of Sephor, seith thus, Tarye thou not to come to me, redi to onoure thee;
17 and what euer thing thou wolt, Y schal yyue to thee; come thou, and curse this puple.
18 Balaam answeride, Thouy Balaach schal yyue to me his howsful of siluer and of gold, Y schal not mowe chaunge the word of my God, that Y speke ethir more ethir lesse.
19 Y biseche, that ye dwelle here also in this nyyt, that Y may wite what the Lord schal answere eft to me.
20 Therfor the Lord cam to Balaam in the nyyt, and seide to hym, If these men comen to clepe thee, rise thou, and go with hem, so oneli that thou do that that Y schal comaunde to thee.
21 Balaam roos eerli, and whanne his femal asse was sadelid, he yede forth with hem.
22 And God was wrooth. And the `aungel of the Lord stood in the weie ayens Balam, that sat on the femal asse, and hadde twei children with hym.
23 The femal asse siy the aungel stondynge in the weie, with swerd drawun, and `turnede a wei hir silf fro the weie, and yede bi the feeld. And whanne Balaam beet hir, and wolde lede ayen to the path,
24 the aungel stood in the streitnessis of twei wallis, with whiche the vyneris weren cumpassid.
25 And the femal asse siy the aungel, and ioynede hir silf to the wal, and hurtlide the foot of the sittere; and he beet eft `the asse.
26 And neuer the lesse the aungel yede to the streit place, where me `myyte not go out of the weie, nether to the riyt side nether to the left side, and stood ayens hym.
27 And whanne the femal asse siy the aungel stondynge, sche felde doun vndir the feet of the sittere, which was  wrooth ful greetli, and beet hir sidis with a staaf.
28 And the Lord openyde the `mouth of the femal asse, and sche spak, What have Y doon to thee? whi smytist thou me, lo! now the thridde tyme?
29 Balaam answeride, For thou hast disserued, and hast scornyd me; Y wolde that Y hadde a swerd to sle thee.
30 And the femal asse seide, Whether Y am not thi beeste on which thou were wont to sitte euere til in to this present dai? seie thou, what lijk thing Y dide euere to thee? And he seide, Neuere.
31 Anoon the Lord openyde `the iyen of Balaam, and he siy the aungel stondynge in the weie, holdynge a drawun swerd in the hoond; and Balaam worschipide hym lowli in to erthe.
32 To whom the aungel seide, Whi `betist thou thi femal asse `the thridde tyme? Y cam to be aduersarie to thee, for thi weie is weiward, and contrarye to me;
33 and if the femal asse hadde not bowid a wey fro the weie, and youe place to ayenstondere, Y hadde slayn thee, and sche schulde lyue.
34 Balaam seide, Y synnede, not witynge that thou stodist ayens me; and now, if it displesith thee that Y go, Y schal turne ayen.
35 The aungel seide, Go thou with these men, but be war that thou speke not other thing than Y schal comaunde to thee. Therfor Balaam yede with the princes.
36 And whanne Balaach hadde herde this, he yede out in to the comyng of hym, in the citee of Moabitis, whiche is set in the laste coostis of Arnon.
37 And he seide to Balaam, Y sente messangeris to clepe thee; whi camest thou not anoon to me? whethir for Y may not yelde meede to thi comyng?
38 To whom Balaam answeride, Lo! Y am present, whethir Y schal mow speke other thing than that, that God schal putte in  my mouth?
39 Therfor thei yeden forth to gidere, and camen in to a citee, which was in the laste coost of `his rewme.
40 And whanne Balaach hadde slayn scheep and oxun, he sente yiftis to Balaam and the princes that weren with hym.
41 Forsothe whanne the morewtid was maad, Balaach ledde Balaam to the hiye placis of Baal, and he bihelde the laste part of the puple, `that is, al the oost til to the laste part.

CAP 23
1 And Balaam seide to Balaach, Bilde thou here to me seuene auteris, and make redi so many caluys, and rammes of the same noumbre.
2 And whanne he hadde do bi the word of Balaam, thei puttiden a calf and a ram to gidere on the auter.
3 And Balaam seide to Balaach, Stond thou a litil while bisidis thi brent sacrifice, while Y go, if in hap the Lord meete me; and Y schal `speke to thee what euer thing he schal comaunde.
4 And whanne he hadde go swiftli, God cam to hym; and Balaam spak to hym, and seide, Y reiside seuene auteris, and Y puttide a calf and a ram aboue.
5 Forsothe the Lord `puttide a word in his mouth, and seide, Turne ayen to Balaach, and thou schalt speke these thingis.
6 He turnede ayen, and fond Balach stondynge bisidis his brent sacrifice, and alle the princes of Moabitis.
7 And whanne his parable `was takun, he seide, Balaach, the kyng of Moabitis, brouyte me fro Aran, fro the `hillis of the eest; and he seide, Come thou and curse Jacob; haaste thou, and greetli curse thou Israel.
8 How schal Y curse whom God cursid not? bi what resoun schal Y `haue abhomynable whom God `hath not abhomynable?
9 Fro the  hiyeste flyntis Y schal se hym, and fro litle hillis Y schal biholde hym; the puple schal dwelle aloone, and it schal not be arettid among hethene men.
10 Who may noumbre the dust, that is, kynrede, of Jacob, and knowe the noumbre of the generacioun of Israel? My lijf die in the deeth of iust men, and my laste thingis be maad lijk hem!
11 And Balaach seide to Balaam, What is this that thou doist? Y clepide thee, that thou schuldist curse myn enemyes, and ayenward thou blessist hem.
12 To whom Balaam answeride, Whether Y may speke othir thing no but that that the Lord comaundith?
13 Therfor Balaach seide to Balaam, Come with me in to anothir place, fro whennus thou se a part of Israel, and mayst not se al; fro thennus curse thou hym.
14 And whanne he hadde led Balaam in to an hiy place, on the cop of the hil of Phasga, he bildide seuene auteris to Balaam, and whanne calues and rammes weren put aboue,
15 he seide to Balaach, Stonde here bisidis thi brent sacrifice, while Y go.
16 And whanne the Lord hadde `come to him, and hadde put `a word in his mouth, he seide, Turne ayen to Balach, and thou schalt seie these thingis to hym.
17 He turnyde ayen, and foond Balach stondynge bisidis his brent sacrifice, and the princis of Moabitis with hym. To whom Balach seide, What spak the Lord?
18 And whanne his parable `was takun, he seide, Stonde, Balach, and herkene; here, thou sone of Sephor. God is not `as a man,
19 that he lye, nethir he is as the sone of a man, that he be chaungid; therfor he seide, and schal he not do? he spak, and schal he not fulfille?
20 Y am brouyt to blesse, Y may not forbede blessyng.
21 Noon idol is in Jacob, nethir symylacre is seyn in Israel; his Lord God is  with hym, and the sown of victorie of kyng is in hym.
22 The Lord God ledde hym out of Egipt, whos strengthe is lijk an vnicorn;
23 fals tellyng bi chiteryng of bryddis, `ethir idolatrie, is not in Jacob, nethir fals dyuynyng is in Israel. In his tymes it schal be seide to Jacob and Israel, What the Lord hath wrought!
24 Lo! the puple schal rise to gidere as a lionesse, and schal be reisid as a lioun; the lioun schal not reste, til he deuoure prey, and drynke the blood of hem that ben slayn.
25 And Balach seide to Balaam, Nether curse thou, nether blesse thou hym.
26 And he seide, Whether Y seide not to thee, that what euer thing that God comaundide to me, Y wolde do this?
27 And Balach seide to hym, Come, and Y schal lede thee to an other place, if in hap it plesith God that fro thennus thou curse hym.
28 And whanne Balaach hadde led hym out on the `cop of the hil of Phegor, that biholdith the wildirnesse,
29 Balaam seide to hym, Bilde here seuene auteris to me, and make redi so many caluys, and rammes of the same noumbre.
30 Balaach dide as Balaam seide, and he puttide caluys and rammes, bi alle auteris.

CAP 24
1 And whanne Balaam siy that it pleside the Lord that he schulde blesse Israel, he yede not as he `hadde go bifore, `that he schulde seke fals dyuynyng `bi chiteryng of briddis, but he dresside his face ayens the desert,
2 and reiside iyen, and siy Israel dwellynge in tentis bi hise lynagis. And whanne the Spirit of God felde on hym, and whanne a parable was takun,
3 he seide, Balaam, the sone of Beor, seide, a man whois iye is stoppid seide,
4 the herere of Goddis wordis seide, which bihelde the reuelacioun of almyyti God, which fallith  doun, and hise iyen ben openyd so, Hou faire ben thi tabernaclis,
5 Jacob, and thi tentis, Israel!
6 as valeys ful of woodis, and moiste gardyns bisidis floodis, as tabernaclis whiche the Lord hath set, as cedris bisidis watris;
7 watir schal flowe of his bokat, and his seed schal be in to many watris, `that is, puplis. The kyng of hym schal be takun a wei for Agag, and the rewme of hym schal be doon awai.
8 God ledde hym out of Egipt, whos strengthe is lijk an vnicorn; thei schulen deuoure hethene men, enemyes `of hym, that is, of Israel; and thei schulen breke the boonus of hem, and schulen perse with arowis.
9 He restide and slepte as a lyoun, and as a lionesse, whom no man schal dore reise. He that blessith thee, schal be blessid; he that cursith, schal
10 be arettid in to cursyng And Balaach was wrooth ayens Balaam, and seide, whanne the hondis weren wrungun to gidere, I clepide thee to curse myn enemyes, whiche ayenward thou hast blessid thries.
11 Turne ayen to thi place; forsothe Y demede to onoure thee greetli, but the Lord priuyde thee fro onour disposid.
12 Balaam answeride to Balaach, Whethir Y seide not to thi messangeris, whiche thou sentist to me,
13 Thouy Balaach schal yyue to me his hows ful of siluer and of gold, Y schal not mow passe the word of my Lord God, that Y brynge forth of myn herte ony thing, ethir of good ethir of yuel, but what euer thing the Lord schal seie, Y schal speke this?
14 Netheles Y schal go to my puple, and Y schal yyue counsel to thee, what thi puple schal do in the laste tyme to this puple.
15 Therfor whanne a parable was takun, he seide eft, Balaam, the sone of Beor seide, a man  whos iye is stoppid,
16 seide, the herere of Goddis wordis seide, which knowith the doctrine of the hiyeste, and seeth the reuelacioun of almiyti God, which fallith doun and hath opyn iyen,
17 Y schal se hym, but not now; Y schal biholde hym, but not nyy; a sterre schal be borun of Jacob, and a yerde schal rise of Israel; and he schal smyte the duykis of Moab, and he schal waste alle the sones of Seth; and Ydumye schal be hys possessioun,
18 the eritage of Seir schal bifalle to his enemyes; forsothe Israel schal do strongli, of Jacob schal be he that schal be lord,
19 and schal leese the relikis of the citee.
20 And whanne he hadde seyn Amalech, he took a parable, and seide, Amalech is the bigynning of hethene men, whos laste thingis schulen be lost.
21 Also `he siy Cyney, and whanne a parable was takun, he seide, Forsothe thi dwellyng place is strong, but if thou schalt sette thi nest in a stoon,
22 and schalt be chosun of the generacioun of Cyn, hou longe schalt thou mow dwelle? forsothe Assur schal take thee.
23 And whanne a parable was takun, he spak eft, Alas! who schal lyue, whanne the Lord schal make thes thingis?
24 Thei schulen come in grete schippis fro Ytalie, thei schulen ouercome Assiries, and thei schulen distrie Ebrews, and at the last also thei hem silf schulen perische.
25 And Balaam roos, and turnide ayen in to his place; and Balaach yede ayen bi the weye in which he cam.

CAP 25
1 Forsothe in that tyme Israel dwellide in Sechym; and the puple dide fornycacioun with the douytris of Moab;
2 whiche douytris clepiden hem to her sacrifices, and thei eten, and worschipiden the  goddis of tho douytris;
3 and Israel made sacrifice to Belphegor. And the Lord was wrooth,
4 and seide to Moises, Take thou alle the princes of the puple, and hange hem ayens the sunne in iebatis, that my wodnesse, `that is stronge veniaunce, be turned awai fro Israel.
5 And Moises seide to the iugis of Israel, Ech man sle his neiyboris, that maden sacrifice to Belphagor.
6 And, lo! oon of the sones of Israel entride bifor his britheren to `an hoore of Madian, in the siyt of Moises, and al the cumpeny of the sones of Israel, whiche wepten bifor the yatis of the tabernacle.
7 And whanne Phynees, the sone of Eleazar, sone of Aaron, preest, hadde seyn this, he roos fro the myddis of the multitude; and whanne he hadde take a swerd,
8 he entride aftir the man of Israel in to the `hoore hows, and stikide thorou both togidere, that is, the man and the womman, in the places of gendryng. And the veniaunce ceesside fro the sones of Israel,
9 and foure and twenti thousand of men weren slayn.
10 And the Lord seide to Moises,
11 Fynees, the sone of Eleazar, sone of Aaron, preest, turnede away myn yre fro the sones of Israel; for he was stirid ayens hem bi my feruent loue, that Y my silf schulde not do awai the sones of Israel in my greet hete, `ether strong veniaunce.
12 Therfor speke thou to hym, Lo! Y yyue to hym the pees of my couenaunt,
13 and it schal be an euerlastynge couenaunt of preesthod, as wel to hym silf as to his seed; for he louyde feruentli for his God, and he clenside the greet trespas of the sones of Israel.
14 Forsothe the name of the man of Israel, that was slayn with the womman of Madian, was Zambri, the sone of Salu, duyk of the kynrede and lynage of Symeon.
15 Forsothe  the womman of Madian that was slayn togidere, was clepid Cobri, the douyter of Sur, the nobleste prince of Madianytis.
16 And the Lord spak to Moises and seide,
17 `Madianytis feele you enemyes, and smyte ye hem;
18 for also thei diden enemyliche ayens you, and disseyueden thorow tresouns, bi the idol of Phegor, and bi `the douyter of Corbri, duyk of Madian, her sister, which douyter was sleyn in the dai of veniaunce, for the sacrilege of Phegor.

CAP 26
1 Aftir that the blood of gilti men was sched out, the Lord seide to Moises and to Eleasar,
2 preest, sone of Aaron, Noumbre ye al the summe of the sones of Israel, fro twenti yeer and aboue, bi her housis, and kynredis, alle men that mowen go forth to batels.

CAP 30
1 And Moises telde to the sones of Israel alle thingis whiche the Lord comaundide to hym.
2 And he spak to the princes of the lynagis of the sones of Israel, This is the word, which the Lord comaundide, If ony of men makith a vowe to the Lord,
3 ethir byndith hym silf bi an ooth, he schal not make voide his word, but he schal fille al thing which he bihiyte.
4 If a womman which is in the hows of hir fadir, and is yit in the age of a damysel, `that is, not yit weddid, avowith ony thing, ethir byndith hir silf bi an ooth, `if the fadir knowith the avow, which sche bihiyte, and the ooth bi which sche boond hir soule, and he is stille, sche schal be gilti of the ooth, that is, boundun bi the ooth;

13 Sotheli if the hosebonde ayenseide anoon, sche schal not be holdun gilti of biheest, for the hosebonde ayenseide, and the Lord schal be merciful to hir.

15 That if the hosebonde herith, and is stille, and delaieth the sentence in the tother dai, sche schal yelde what euer thing sche avowide and bihiyte, for he was stille, anoon as he herde.

13 Moises and Eleazar, preest, and alle the princes of the synagoge, yeden out in to the comyng of hem, with out the castels, `that is, of the tabernacle.
14 And Moises was wrooth to the princes of the oost, to tribunes, and centuriouns, that camen fro batel;  and he seide, Whi reserueden ye wymmen?

16 whether it be not these that disseyueden the sones of Israel, at the suggestioun of Balaam, and maden you to do trespas ayens the Lord, on the synne of Phegor, wherfor also the puple was slayn?
17 And therfor sle ye alle men, what euer thing is of male kynde, and litle children; and strangle ye the wymmen that knew men fleischli;
18 forsothe reserue ye to you damesels, and alle wymmen virgyns,
19 and dwelle ye with out the castels in seuene daies. He that sleeth a man, ether touchith a slayn man, schal be clensid in the thridde and the seuenthe dai;

21 And Eleazar, preest, spak thus to the men of the oost that fouyten, This is the comaundement of the lawe, which the Lord comaundide to Moises,
22 The gold, and siluer, and bras, and yrun, and tiyn, and leed, and al thing that may passe by flawme, schal be purgid bi fier;

24 And ye schulen waische youre clothis in the seuenthe dai, and ye schulen be clensid; and aftirward ye schulen entre in to the castels `of the tabernacle.
25 And the Lord seide to Moises, Take ye the summe of tho thingis that ben takun, fro man `til to beeste,
26 thou, and Eleazar, preest, and alle the princes of the comyn puple.
27 And thou schalt departe euenli the prey bytwixe hem that fouyten and yeden out to batel, and bitwixe al the multitude.
28 And thou schalt departe a part to the Lord, of hem that fouyten, and weren in batel, `o soule of fiue hundrid,  as wel of men, as of oxun, and of assis, and of scheep.
29 And thou schalt yyue `that part to Eleazar, preest, for tho ben the firste fruytis of the Lord.
30 Also of the myddil part of the sones of Israel, thou schalt take the fiftithe heed of men, and of oxun, and of assis, and of scheep, and of alle lyuynge beestis; and thou schalt yyue tho to the dekenes, that waken in the kepyngis of the tabernacle of the Lord.
31 And Moyses and Eleazar diden, as the Lord comaundide.
32 Forsothe the prey which the oost hadde take, was sixe hundrid fyue and seuenti thousynde of scheep,

42 of the myddil part of the sones of Israel, which he departide to hem that weren in batel.
43 And of the myddil part that bifelde to the tother multitude, that is, of thre hundrid seuene and thretti thousynde scheep and fyue hundrid,

46 Moyses took the fyftithe heed,
47 and yaf  to the dekenes, that wakiden in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord comaundide.
48 And whanne the princes of the oost, and the tribunes and centuriouns hadden neiyed to Moises,

CAP 32
1 Forsothe the sones of Ruben and of Gad hadden many beestis, and catel with out noumbre was to hem, in werk beestis. And whanne thei hadden seyn Jazer and Galaad, couenable londis to beestis to be fed,

4 and Nebo, and Beon, the lond which the Lord smoot in the siyt of the sones of Israel, is of moost plenteuous cuntrey to the pasture of beestis; and we thi seruauntis han ful many beestis;
5 and we preyen, if we han founde grace bifor thee, that thou yyue to vs thi seruauntis  that cuntrey in to possessioun, and make not vs to passe Jordan.
6 To whiche Moises answeride, Whether youre britheren schulen go to batel, and ye schulen sitte here?
7 Whi peruerten ye the soulis of Israel, that thei doren not passe in to the place, which the Lord schal yyue to hem?
8 Whether youre fadris diden not so, whanne Y sente fro Cades Barne to aspie the lond,

10 And the Lord was wrooth, and swoor,
11 seiynge, Thes men that stieden fro Egipt, fro twenti yeer and aboue, schulen not se the lond which Y bihiyte vndur an ooth to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and nolden sue me,
12 outakun Caleph, Cenezei, the sone of Jephone, and Josue, the sone of Nun; these tweyne filliden my wille.
13 And the Lord was wrooth ayens Israel, and ledde hym aboute the deseert bi fourti yeer, til al the generacioun was wastid, that hadde do yuel in the `siyt of the Lord.
14 And Moyses seide, Lo! ye encressyngis, and nurreis, `ether nurschid children, of synful men, han ryse for youre fadris, that ye schulden encreesse the strong veniaunce of the Lord ayens Israel.
15 That if ye nylen sue the Lord, in `the wildirnesse he schal forsake the puple, and ye schulen be cause of the deeth of alle men.
16 And thei neiyiden nyy, and seiden, We schulen make foldis of scheep, and the stablis of beestis, and we schulen make strengthid citees to oure litle children.
17 Forsothe we vs silf schulen be armed `to defence, and schulen be gird `with armeris to asailyng, and schulen go to batel bifor the sones of Israel,  til we bryngen hem in to her places; oure litle children and what euer thing we moun haue, schulen be in strengthid cytees, for the tresouns of the dwelleris.
18 We schulen not turne ayen in to oure housis, til the sones of Israel welden her eritage;
19 and we schulen not axe ony thing ouer Jordan, for we han now oure possessioun in the eest coost therof.
20 To whiche Moises seide, If ye doen that, that ye biheten, be ye maad redi, and go ye to batel bifor the Lord;
21 and ech man fiytere be armed, and passe Jordan, til the Lord distrye hise enemyes,
22 and al the lond be maad suget to hym; thanne ye schulen be giltles anentis God, and anentis Israel, and ye schulen holde the cuntreys, whiche ye wolen, bifor the Lord.
23 But if ye doon not that, that ye seien, it is not doute to ony man, that ne ye synnen ayens God; and wite ye, that youre synne schal take you.
24 Therfor bilde ye citees to youre litle children, and foldis and stablis to scheep, and to beestis; and fille ye that, that ye bihiyten.
25 And the sones of Gad and of Ruben seiden to Moises, We ben thi seruauntis; we schulen do that, that oure lord comaundith.
26 We schulen leeue oure litle children, and wymmen, and scheep, and beestis in the citees of Galaad;
27 forsothe alle we thi seruauntis schulen go redi to batel, as thou, lord, spekist.
28 Therfor Moyses comaundide to Eleazar, preest, and to Josue, the sone of Nun, and to the princes of meynees, bi the lynagis of Israel, and seide to hem,
29 If the sones of Gad, and the sones of Ruben goen alle armed with you, to batel bifor the Lord, and the lond be maad suget to you, yyue ye to hem Galaad in to possessioun;
30 but if thei nylen passe with you in to the lond of Chanaan, take thei places to dwelle among you.
31 And the sones of Gad and the sones of Ruben answeriden,  As the Lord spak to hise seruauntis, so we schulen do;

17 If he castith a stoon, and a man is deed bi the strook, he schal be punyschid in lijk maner.
18 If a man smytun with a staf dieth, he schal be vengid bi `the blood of the smytere.
19 The niy kynesman of hym that is slayn schal sle the mansleere; anoon as he takith  hym, `that is, the manquellere, he schal sle hym.
20 If bi haterede a man hurtlith, `ethir schoufith, `a man, ethir castith ony thing in to hym bi aspiyngis,

33 which is defoulid bi the blood of  innocent men; and it may not be clensid in other maner, no but bi the blood of hym, that schedde the blood of anothir man.
34 And so youre possessioun schal be clensid, for Y schal dwelle with you; for Y am the Lord, that dwelle among the sones of Israel.

1 Forsothe and the princes of the meynees of Galaad sone of Machir, sone of Manasses, of the generacioun of the sones of Joseph, neiyiden, and spaken to Moises bifor the princes of Israel,

3 And if men of anothir lynage schulen take to wyues these douytris, her possessioun schal sue, and it schal be translatid to anothir lynage, and schal be decreessid fro oure eritage;

8 and alle wymmen schulen take hosebondis of the same lynage, that the erytage dwelle in meynees,
9 and lynagis be not meddlid to hem silf, but dwelle so,
10 as tho ben departid of the  Lord. And the douytris of Salphaat diden, as it was comaundid to hem.
11 And Maala, and Thersa, and Egla, and Melcha, and Noha, weren weddid to the sones of her fadris brother,
12 of the meynee of Manaasses, that was `the sone of Joseph, and the possessioun that was youun to hem, dwellide in the lynage and meynee of her fadir.
13 These ben the comaundementis and domes, whiche the Lord comaundide, bi the hond of Moyses, to the sones of Israel, in the feeldi places of Moab, aboue Jordan, ayens Jericho.
