1 But, britheren, we preien you bi the comyng of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and of oure congregacioun in to the same comyng,
2 that ye be not mouyd soone fro youre witt, nether be aferd, nether bi spirit, nether bi word, nether bi epistle as sent bi vs, as if the dai of the Lord be nyy.
3 No man disseyue you in ony manere. For but dissencioun come first, and the man of synne be schewid, the sonne of perdicioun,
4 that is aduersarie, and is enhaunsid ouer `al thing that is seid God, or that is worschipid, so that he sitte in the temple of God, and schewe hym silf as if he were God.
5 Whether ye holden not, that yit whanne Y was at you, Y seide these thingis to you?
6 And now what withholdith, ye witen, that he be schewid in his tyme.
7 For the priuete of wickidnesse worchith now; oneli that he that holdith now, holde, til he be do awei.
8 And thanne thilke wickid man schal be schewid, whom the Lord Jhesu schal sle with the spirit of his mouth, and schal distrie with liytnyng of his comyng;
9 hym, whos comyng is bi the worching of Sathanas, in al vertu, and signes,
10 and grete wondris, false, and in al disseit of wickidnesse, to hem that perischen. For that thei resseyueden not the charite of treuthe, that thei schulden be maad saaf. And therfor God schal sende to hem a worching of errour, that thei bileue to leesing,
11 that alle be demed, whiche bileueden not to treuthe, but consentiden to wickidnesse.
12 But, britheren louyd of God, we owen to do thankyngis euermore to God for you, that God chees vs the firste fruytis in to heelthe, in halewing of spirit and in feith of treuthe;
13 in which also he clepide you bi oure gospel, in to geting of the glorie of oure Lord Jhesu Crist.
14 Therfor, britheren, stonde ye, and holde ye the tradiciouns, that ye han lerud, ethir bi word, ethir bi oure pistle.
15 And oure Lord Jhesu Crist him silf, and God oure fadir, which louyde vs, and yaf euerlastinge coumfort and good hope in grace, stire youre hertis,
16 and conferme in al good werk and word.

1 Britheren, fro hennus forward preye ye for vs, that the word of God renne, and be clarified, as it is anentis you;
2 and that we be delyuered fro noyous and yuele men; for feith is not of alle men.
3 But the Lord is trewe, that schal conferme you, and schal kepe fro yuel.
4 And, britheren, we trusten of you in the Lord, for what euere thingis we comaunden to you, bothe ye don and schulen do.
5 And the Lord dresse youre hertis, in the charite of God, and in the pacience of Crist.
6 But, britheren, we denouncen to you in the name of oure Lord Jhesu Crist, that ye withdrawe you from ech brother that wandrith out of ordre, and not aftir the techyng, that thei resseyueden of vs.
7 For `ye silf witen, hou it bihoueth to sue vs. For we weren not vnpesible among you,
8 nethir with outen oure owne trauel we eeten breed of ony man, but in trauel and werynesse worchiden niyt and dai, that we greuyden noon of you.
9 Not as we hadden not power, but that we schulden yyue vs silf ensaumple to you to sue vs.
10 For also whanne we weren among you, we denounsiden this thing to you, that if ony man wole not worche, nethir ete he.
11 For we han herd that summe among you goon in reste, and no thing worchen, but don curiousli.
12 But we denouncen to hem that ben suche men, and bisechen in the Lord Jhesu Crist, that thei worchen with silence, and ete her owne breed.
13 But nyle ye, britheren, faile wel doynge.
14 That if ony man obeie not to oure word bi epistle, marke ye him, and comyne ye not with hym, that he be schamed;
15 and nyle ye gesse hym as an enemye, but repreue ye hym as a brother. And God hym silf of pees yyue to you euerlastinge pees in al place.
16 The Lord be with `you alle.
17 My salutacioun bi the hoond of Poul; which signe in ech epistle Y write thus.
18 The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with `alle you. Amen.
