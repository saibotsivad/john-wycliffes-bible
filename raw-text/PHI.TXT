1 Poul and Tymothe, seruauntis of Jhesu Crist, to alle the hooli men in Crist Jhesu, that ben at Filippis, with bischopis and dekenes,
2 grace and pees to you of God oure fadir, and of the Lord Jhesu Crist.
3 I do thankyngis to my God
4 in al mynde of you euere more in alle my preyeris for alle you with ioye, and
5 make a bisechyng on youre comynyng in the gospel of Crist, fro the firste day til nowe;
6 tristenynge this ilke thing, that he that bigan in you a good werk, schal perfourme it til in to the dai of Jhesu Crist.
7 As it is iust to me to feele this thing for alle you, for that Y haue you in herte, and in my boondis, and in defending and confermyng of the gospel, that alle ye be felowis of my ioye.
8 For God is a witnesse to me, hou Y coueyte alle you in the bowelis of Jhesu Crist.
9 And this thing Y preie, that youre charite be plenteuouse more and more in kunnyng, and in al wit;
10 that ye preue the betere thingis, that ye be clene and without offence in the dai of Crist;
11 fillid with the fruyt of riytwysnesse bi Jhesu Crist, in to the glory and the heriyng of God.
12 For, britheren, Y wole that ye wite, that the thingis that ben aboute me han comun more to the profit of the gospel,
13 so that my boondis weren maad knowun in Crist, in ech moot halle, and in alle other placis;
14 that mo of britheren tristinge in the Lord more plenteuously for my boondis, dursten without drede speke the word of God.
15 But summe for enuye and strijf, summe for good wille, prechen Crist;
16 and summe of charite, witinge that Y am put in the defense of the gospel.
17 But summe of strijf schewen Crist not cleneli, gessynge hem to reise tribulacioun to my boondis.
18 But what? the while on al maner, ethir bi occasioun, ethir bi treuthe, Crist is schewid; and in this thing Y haue ioye, but also Y schal haue ioye.
19 And Y woot, that this thing schal come to me in to heelthe bi youre preyer, and the vndurmynystring of the spirit of `Jhesu Crist, bi myn abidyng and hope.
20 For in no thing Y schal be schamed, but in al trist as euere more and now, Crist schal be magnefied in my bodi, ether bi lijf, ether bi deth.
21 For me to lyue is Crist, and to die is wynnyng.
22 That if to lyue in fleisch, is fruyt of werk to me, lo! what Y schal chese, Y knowe not.
23 But Y am constreyned of twei thingis, Y haue desire to be dissolued, and to be with Crist, it is myche more betere; but to dwelle in fleisch,
24 is nedeful for you.
25 And Y tristinge this thing, woot that Y schal dwelle, and perfitli dwelle to alle you, to youre profit and ioye of feith,
26 that youre thanking abounde in Crist Jhesu in me, bi my comyng eftsoone to you.
27 Oneli lyue ye worthili to the gospel of Crist, that whether whanne Y come and se you, ethir absent Y here of you, that ye stonden in o spirit of o wille, trauelinge togidere to the feith of the gospel.
28 And in no thing be ye aferd of aduersaries, which is to hem cause of perdicioun,
29 but to you cause of heelthe. And this thing is of God. For it is youun to you for Crist, that not oneli ye bileuen in hym, but also that ye suffren for hym;
30 hauynge the same strijf, which ye saien in me, and now ye han herd of me.

CAP 2
1 Therfor if ony coumfort is in Crist, if ony solace of charite, if ony felouschipe of spirit, if ony inwardnesse of merci doyng,
2 fille ye my ioye, that ye vndurstonde the same thing, and haue the same charite, of o wille, and feelen the same thing;
3 no thing bi strijf, nether by veyn glorie, but in mekenesse, demynge eche othere to be heiyer than hym silf;
4 not biholdinge ech bi hym silf what thingis ben his owne, but tho thingis that ben of othere men.
5 And fele ye this thing in you, which also in Crist Jhesu;
6 that whanne he was in the forme of God, demyde not raueyn, that hym silf were euene to God;
7 but he lowide hym silf, takinge the forme of a seruaunt, and was maad in to the licknesse of men, and in abite was foundun as a man.
8 He mekide hym silf, and was maad obedient to the deth, yhe, to the deth of the cross.
9 For which thing God enhaunside hym, and yaf to hym a name that is aboue al name;
10 that in the name of Jhesu ech kne be bowid, of heuenli thingis, of ertheli thingis, and of hellis;
11 and ech tunge knouleche, that the Lord Jhesu Crist is in the glorie of God the fadir.
12 Therfor, my most dereworthe britheren, as euere more ye han obeischid, not in my presence onely, but myche more now in myn absence, worche ye with drede and trembling youre heelthe.
13 For it is God that worchith in you, bothe to wilne, and to performe, for good wille.
14 And do ye alle thingis with out grutchingis and doutyngis;
15 that ye be with out playnt, and symple as the sones of God, with out repreef, in the myddil of a schrewid nacioun and a weiward; among whiche ye schynen as yyueris of liyt in the world.
16 And holde ye togidere the word of lijf to my glorie in the day of Crist; for Y haue not runnen in veyn, nether Y haue trauelid in veyn.
17 But thouy Y be offrid or slayn on the sacrifice and seruyce of youre feith, Y haue ioye, and Y thanke you alle.
18 And the same thing haue ye ioye, and thanke ye me.
19 And Y hope in the Lord Jhesu, that Y schal sende Tymothe soone to you, that Y be of good coumfort, whanne tho thingis ben knowun that ben aboute you.
20 For Y haue no man so of o wille, that is bisi for you with clene affeccioun.
21 For alle men seken tho thingis that ben her owne, not tho that ben of Crist Jhesu.
22 But knowe ye the asaie of hym, for as a sone to the fadir he hath seruyd with me in the gospel.
23 Therfor Y hope that Y schal sende hym to you, anoon as Y se what thingis ben aboute me.
24 And Y triste in the Lord, that also my silf schal come to you soone.
25 And Y gesside it nedeful to sende to you Epafrodite, my brother and euene worchere, and myn euene knyyt, but youre apostle, and the mynystre of my nede.
26 For he desiride you alle, and he was sorewful, therfor that ye herden that he was sijk.
27 For he was sijk to the deth, but God hadde merci on him; and not oneli on hym, but also on me, lest Y hadde heuynesse on heuynesse.
28 Therfor more hastili Y sente hym, that whanne ye han seyn hym, ye haue ioye eft, and Y be withouten heuynesse.
29 Therfor resseyue ye hym with al ioye in the Lord, and haue ye suche with al onour.
30 For the werk of Crist he wente to deth, yyuynge his lijf, that he schulde fulfille that that failide of you anentis my seruyce.

CAP 3
1 Hennus forward, my britheren, haue ye ioye in the Lord. To write to you the same thingis, to me it is not slow, and to you it is necessarie.
2 Se ye houndis, se ye yuele werk men, se ye dyuysioun.
3 For we ben circumcisioun, which bi spirit seruen to God, and glorien in Crist Jhesu, and han not trist in the fleisch,
4 thouy Y haue trust, yhe, in the fleisch. If ony othere man is seyn to triste in the fleisch,
5 Y more, that was circumcidid in the eiytthe dai, of the kyn of Israel, of the lynage of Beniamyn, an Ebrew of Ebrewis, bi the lawe a Farisee,
6 bi loue pursuynge the chirche of God, bi riytwisnesse that is in the lawe lyuynge with out playnt.
7 But whiche thingis weren to me wynnyngis, Y haue demed these apeyryngis for Crist.
8 Netheles Y gesse alle thingis to be peirement for the cleer science of Jhesu Crist my Lord. For whom Y made alle thingis peyrement, and Y deme as drit,
9 that Y wynne Crist, and that Y be foundun in hym, not hauynge my riytwisnesse that is of the lawe, but that that is of the feith of Crist Jhesu, that is of God the riytwisnesse in feith,
10 to knowe hym, and the vertu of his risyng ayen, and the felouschipe of his passioun, and be maad lijk to his deeth,
11 if on ony maner Y come to the resurreccioun that is fro deth.
12 Not that now Y haue takun, or now am parfit; but Y sue, if in ony maner Y comprehende, in which thing also Y am comprehendid of Crist Jhesu.
13 Bretheren, Y deme me not that Y haue comprehendid; but o thing, Y foryete tho thingis that ben bihyndis, and stretche forth my silf to tho thingis that ben bifore,
14 and pursue to the ordeyned mede of the hiy clepyng of God in Crist Jhesu.
15 Therfor who euere we ben perfit, feele we this thing. And if ye vndurstonden in othere manere ony thing, this thing God schal schewe to you.
16 Netheles to what thing we han comun, that we vndurstonden the same thing, and that we perfitli dwelle in the same reule.
17 Britheren, be ye my foleweris, and weyte ye hem that walken so, as ye han oure fourme.
18 For many walken, whiche Y haue seid ofte to you, but now Y wepinge seie, the enemyes of Cristis cros,
19 who ende is deth, whos god is the wombe, and the glorie in confusioun of hem, that saueren ertheli thingis.
20 But oure lyuyng is in heuenes; fro whennus also we abiden the sauyour oure Lord Jhesu Crist,
21 which schal reforme the bodi of oure mekenesse, that is maad lijk to the bodi of his clerenesse, bi the worching bi which he mai `also make alle thingis suget to hym.

CAP 4
1 Therfor, my britheren most dereworthe and most desirid, my ioye and my coroun, so stonde ye in the Lord, most dere britheren.
2 Y preye Eucodiam, and biseche Synticem, to vndurstonde the same thing in the Lord.
3 Also Y preye and thee, german felow, helpe thou the ilke wymmen that traueliden with me in the gospel, with Clement and othere myn helperis, whos names ben in the book of lijf.
4 Ioye ye in the Lord euere more; eft Y seie, ioye ye.
5 Be youre pacyence knowun to alle men; the Lord is niy.
6 Be ye nothing bisi, but in al preyer and biseching, with doyng of thankyngis, be youre axyngis knowun at God.
7 And the pees of God, that passith al wit, kepe youre hertis and vndurstondingis in Crist Jhesu.
8 Fro hennus forth, britheren, what euere thingis ben sothe, what euere thingis chast, what euere thingis iust, what euere thingis hooli, what euere thingis able to be louyd, what euere thingis of good fame, if ony vertu, if ony preising of discipline, thenke ye these thingis,
9 that also ye han lerud, and take, and heed, and seyn in me. Do ye these thingis, and God of pees schal be with you.
10 But Y ioyede greetli in the Lord, that sum tyme aftirward ye floureden ayen to feele for me, as also ye feeliden. But ye weren ocupied, Y seie not as for nede,
11 for Y haue lerud to be sufficient in whiche thingis Y am.
12 And Y can also be lowid, Y can also haue plentee. Euery where and in alle thingis Y am tauyt to be fillid, and to hungur, and to abounde, and to suffre myseiste.
13 Y may alle thingis in hym that coumfortith me.
14 Netheles ye han doon wel, comynynge to my tribulacioun.
15 For and ye, Filipensis, witen, that in the bigynnyng of the gospel, whanne Y wente forth fro Macedonye, no chirche comynede with me in resoun of thing youun and takun, but ye aloone.
16 Whiche senten to Tessalonyk onys and twies also in to vss to me.
17 Not for Y seke yifte, but Y requyre fruyt aboundinge in youre resoun.
18 For Y haue alle thingis, and abounde; Y am fillid with tho thingis takun of Epafrodite, whiche ye senten in to the odour of swetnesse, a couenable sacrifice, plesynge to God.
19 And my God fil alle youre desire, by hise richessis in glorie in Crist Jhesu.
20 But to God and oure fadir be glorie in to worldis of worldis.
21 Amen. Grete ye wel euery hooli man in Crist Jhesu.
22 Tho britheren that ben with me, greten you wel. Alle hooli men greten you wel, moost sotheli thei that ben of the emperouris hous.
23 The grace of oure Lord Jhesu Crist be with youre spirit. Amen.
