3 and passide forth til to endis of erthe, and took spuylis of multitude of folkis; and the erthe was stille in siyt of hym.
4 And he gaderide vertu, and oost ful strong, and the herte of hym was enhaunsid and lift vp.
5 And he gat the cuntreis of folkis, and tirauntis; and thei weren maad to hym in to tribut.
6 And after these thingis he felle in to bed, and knew that he schulde die.
7 And he clepide his noble children, that weren nurschid with hym fro yongthe, and departide to hem his kingdom, whanne he lyuede yit.
8 And Alisaundre regnede twelue yeer, and was deed.
9 And his children weldiden the rewme,

11 And ther wente out of hem a roote of synne, Antiok the noble, the sone of Antiok kyng, that was at Rome in ostage, and regnede in the hundrid and seuene and thrittithe yeer of the rewme of Grekis.
12 In tho daies wickid sones `of Israel wenten out, and counseiliden many, and seide, Go we, and ordeyne we testament with hethene men, that ben aboute vs; for sithen we departiden fro hem, many yuels foundun vs.
13 And the word was seyn good bifore the iyen of hem.
14 And summe of the puple senten, and wenten to the kyng; and he yaf power to hem for to do riytwisnesse of hethene men.
15 And thei bildiden a scole in Jerusalem, bi lawis of naciouns;
16 and maden to hem prepucies, and wenten awei fro the hooli testament, and weren ioyned to naciouns, and weren seeld for to do yuel.
17 And the rewme hadde prosperite in the siyt of Antiok, and he bigan for to regne in the lond of Egipt, that he schulde regne on twei rewmes.
18 And he entride in to Egipt with a greuouse multitude, in charis, and olifauntis, and horse men, `ether kniytis, and plenteuouse multitude of schippis,
19 and he ordeynede batel ayens Tholome, kyng of Egipt; and Tolome dredde of his face, and flei; and many weren woundid, and fellen doun.
20 And he took the stronge citees in the lond of Egipt, and took the preies of the lond of Egipt.
21 And Antiok turnede, after that he smoot Egipt, in the hundrid and thre and fourtithe yeer, and stiede to Israel.
22 And he stiede to Jerusalem with a greuouse multitude,
23 and entride in to the halewyng with pride; and he took the goldun auter, and the candilstike of liyt, and alle vessels therof, and the boord of proposicioun, and vessels of fletynge sacrifices, and cruetis, and goldun morteris, and veil, and crownes, and goldun ournement that was in the face of the temple; and he brak alle.
24 And he took siluer and gold, and alle desirable vessels, and he took the priuy tresours, whiche he foond; and whanne he hadde takun vp alle thingis, he wente in to his lond.
25 And he made slauyter of men, and spak in greet pride.
26 And greet weilyng was maad in Israel, and in ech place of hem;
27 and princes sorewiden inwardli, and eldere men, and maidens, and yonge men weren maad sike, and fairnesse of wymmen was chaungid.
28 Ech hosebonde took weilyng, and thei that saten in hosebondis bed, morenyden.
29 And the lond was mouyd togidere on men dwellynge therynne, and al the hous of Jacob was clothid with confusioun.
30 And aftir twei yeeris of daies, the kyng sente a prince of tributis in to the citees of Juda, and he cam to Jerusalem with greet cumpanye.
31 And he spak to hem pesible wordis in gile, and thei bileuyden to hym.
32 And sudeynli he felle in on the citee, and smoot it with a greet wounde, and loste myche puple of Israel.
33 And he took preies of the citee, and brente it with fier, and distriede housis therof, and wallis therof in cumpas.
34 And thei ledden wymmen caitif, and children, and weldiden beestis.
35 And thei bildiden the citee of Dauid with greet wal and sad, and sadde touris; and it was maad to hem in to an hiy tour.
36 And thei puttiden there a folc of synneris, wickid men, and thei weren strong in it; and thei puttiden armeris, and metis, and gaderiden preies of Jerusalem;
37 and puttiden vp there, and weren maad in to a greet snare.
38 And this thing was maad to aspiyngis in yuel, `ether tresouns, to halewyng, and in to an yuel deuel in Israel euere more.
39 And thei schedden out innocent blood, bi cumpas of the halewyng, and defouliden the halewyng.
40 And dwelleris of Jerusalem fledden for hem, and it was maad abitacioun of straungeris, and it was maad straunge to his seed, and sones therof forsoken it.
41 The halewyng therof was desolat as wildirnesse; feeste daies therof weren turned in to mourenyng, sabotis therof in to schenschip, onouris therof in to nouyt.
42 Bi the glorie therof the yuel fame therof was multiplied, and hyynesse therof was turned in to mournyng.
43 And kyng Antiok wroot to al his rewme, that al the puple schulde be oon. And thei forsoken ech man his lawe;
44 and alle folkis consentiden bi the word of kyng Antiok,
45 and many of Israel consentiden to him, and sacrifieden to idols, and defouliden sabot.
46 And king Antiok sente bokis bi the hondis of messangeris in to Jerusalem, and in to alle citees of Judee, that thei schulden sue lawis of folkis of erthe,
47 and schulden forbede brent sacrifices, and sacrifices, and plesyngis for to be don in the temple of God,
48 and that thei schulden forbede the sabot for to be halewid, and solempne daies,
49 and hooli thingis for to be defoulid, and the hooli puple of Israel.
50 And he comaundide auteris for to be bildid, and templis, and idols; and swynes fleisch for to be sacrifisid, and vncleene beestis;
51 and for to leeue her sones vncircumcidid, and the soulis of hem for to be defoulid in alle vnclennessis and abhomynaciouns, so that thei schulden foryete the lawe, and schulen chaunge alle the iustifiyngis of God.
52 And who euere dide not bi the word of kyng Antiok, schulden die.
53 Bi alle these wordis he wroot to al his rewme, and aboue settide princes to the puple, whiche schulden constreyne these thingis for to be don.
54 And thei comaundiden to citees of Juda for to make sacrifice.
55 And many of the puple weren gaderid to hem, whiche forsoken the lawe of the Lord, and diden yuels on erthe.
56 And thei dryueden out the puple of Israel fro priuy places, and in hid places of fleynge men.
57 In the fiftenthe dai of the monethe Casleu, in the hundrid and fyue and fourtithe yeer, king Antiok bildide abhominable idol of discoumfort on the auter of God; and bi alle citees of Judee in cumpas thei bildiden auters.
58 And bifore the yatis of housis and in stretis thei brenten encensis, and sacrifieden;
59 and brenten bi fier the bookis of the lawe of God, and keruyden hem.
60 And anentis whom euere the bookis of testament of the Lord weren foundun, and who euere kepte the lawe of the Lord, bi the maundement of the kyng thei slowen hym.
61 In her power thei diden these thingis to the puple of Israel, that was foundun in ech monethe in citees.
62 And in the fyue and twentithe dai of the monethe, thei sacrifieden on the auter, that was ayens the auter of God.
63 And wymmen, that circumcididen her sones, weren stranglid, bi comaundement of kyng Antiok;
64 and thei hangiden children bi the neckis, bi alle housis of hem, and strangliden hem that circumcididen hem.
65 And many of the puple of Israel determyneden anentis hem, that thei schulden not ete vnclene thingis, and chesiden more for to die, than for to be defoulid with vnclene metis.
66 And thei wolden not breke the hooli lawe of God, and thei weren slayn;
67 and ful greet wraththe was maad on the puple.

CAP 2
1 In tho daies Matatias, the sone of Joon, sone of Symeon, and he was prest of the sones of Joarym, roos fro Jerusalem, and sat in the hil Modyn.
2 And he hadde fyue sones; Joon, that was named Gaddis; and Symount, that was named Thasi;
3 and Judas, that was clepid Machabeus;
4 and Eleasarus, that was named Abaron;
5 and Jonathas, that was clepid Apphus.
6 These siyen the yuels that weren don in the puple of Juda and in Jerusalem.
7 And Matatias seide, Wo to me! wher to am Y borun, for to se the distriyng `of my puple, and the defoulyng of the hooli citee, and for to sitte there, whanne it is youun in to the hondis of enemyes?
8 Hooli thingis ben maad in the hond of straungeris; the temple therof as a man vnnoble;
9 vessels of glorie therof ben led awei caitif. Elde men therof ben slayn in stretis, and yonge men therof fellen doun bi swerd of enemyes.
10 What folc enheritide not the kingdom therof, and weldide not preies therof?
11 Al ournyng therof is borun awei; sche that was fre, is maad handmaidun.
12 And lo! oure hooli thing, and oure fairnesse, and oure clerete, is desolat, and hethene men defouliden it.
13 What therfor is yit to vs for to lyue?
14 And Matatias and his sones to-renten her clothis, and hiliden hem with heiris, and weiliden greetli.
15 And thei that weren sent of kyng Antiok, camen thidur, for to constreyne hem that fledden togidere in to the cite of Modyn, for to offre and brenne encensis, and for to departe fro the lawe of God.
16 And many of the puple of Israel consentiden, and camen to hem; but Matatias and his sones stoden stidefastli.
17 And thei answeriden, that weren sent of Antiok, and seiden to Matatias, Thou art prince, and moost clere, and greet in this citee, and ourned with sones and britheren.
18 Therfor go thou the formere, and do the maundement of the kyng, as alle folkis han don, and men of Juda, and thei that leften in Jerusalem. And thou schalt be, and thi sones, among frendis of the king, and maad large in siluer and gold, and many yiftis.
19 And Matatias answeride, and seide with greet vois, Thouy alle folkis obeien to kyng Antiok, that thei go awei ech man fro seruice of the lawe of his fadris, and consenten to his maundementis,
20 Y, and my sones, and my britheren schulen obeie to the lawe of oure fadris.
21 God be helpful to vs; it is not profitable to vs for to forsake the lawe and riytwisnesses of God.
22 We schulen not here the wordis of kyng Antiok, nether schulen make sacrifice to idols, and breke the maundementis of oure lawe, that we go bi anothir weie.
23 And as he ceesside for to speke these wordis, sum Jew wente to, bifore the iyen of alle men, for to sacrifice to idols on the auter, in the citee Modyn, bi comaundement of the kyng.
24 And Matatias siy, and sorewide, and his reynes trembliden togidere, and his woodnesse was kyndlid bi doom of the lawe; and he skippide in, and slow hym on the auter.
25 But and he slow in that tyme the man whom king Antiok sente, which compellide for to offre, and he distriede the auter.
26 And he louyde feruentli the lawe, as Fynees dide to Sambri, sone of Salomy.
27 And Matatias criede with greet vois in the citee, and seide, Ech man that hath feruent loue of the lawe, ordeyne a testament, `that is, a couenaunt, and go out after me.
28 And he flei, and hise sones, in to munteyns, and leften what euere thingis thei hadden in the citee.
29 Thanne many sekynge dom and riytwisnesse, wenten doun in to desert, that thei schulden sitte there,
30 thei, and the sones of hem, and wymmen of hem, and beestis of hem, for yuels weren hard on hem.
31 And it was teld to men of the kyng, and to the oost, that weren in Jerusalem, the citee of Dauid, that summen wenten awei, that distrieden maundement of the kyng, in to priuy places in desert; and many hadden go after hem.
32 And anoon thei wenten to hem, and ordeineden ayens hem batel, in the dai of sabatis;
33 and seiden to hem, Ayenstonde ye also now yit? go ye out, and do ye after the word of kyng Antiok, and ye schulen lyue.
34 And thei seiden, We schulen not go out, nether schulen do the word of the king, that we defoule the dai of sabatis.
35 And thei stiriden batel ayens hem.
36 And thei answeriden not to hem, nether threwen stoon to hem, nether stoppiden priuy places,
37 and seiden, Die we alle in oure simplenesse, and heuene and erthe schulen be witnessis on vs, that vniustli ye lesen vs.
38 And thei yauen to hem batel in sabatis, and thei weren deed, and wyues of hem, and sones of hem, and beestis of hem, til to a thousande persoones of men.
39 And Matatias knew, and his frendis; and thei hadden mournyng on hem greetli.
40 And a man seide to his neiybore, If we alle shulen do as oure britheren diden, and schulen not fiyte ayens hethene men, for oure lyues, and oure iustifiyngis, sunnere thei schulen distrie vs fro erthe.
41 And thei thouyten in that dai, and seiden, Ech man who euere cometh to vs in batel, in dai of sabotis, fiyte we ayens hym, and die we not alle, as oure britheren ben deed in priuy places.
42 Thanne the synagoge of Jewis, strong in myytis of Israel, was gaderid to hem. Euery wilful man in the lawe,
43 and alle that fledden fro yuels, weren addid to hem, and thei weren maad to hem to stidfastnesse.
44 And thei gaderiden an oost, and smytiden synneris in her wraththe, and wickid men in her indignacioun; and the tother fledden to naciouns, for to ascape.
45 And Matatias enuyrownede, and hise frendis, and distrieden auteris,
46 and circumcididen children vncircumcided, hou many euere thei founden in the coostis of Israel, `in strengthe.
47 And thei pursueden the sones of pride, and the werk hadde prosperite in her hondis.
48 And thei gaten the lawe fro hondis of hethene men, and fro hondis of kyngis, and yauen not strengthe to the synnere.
49 And daies of Matatias of diynge neiyiden, and he seide to hise sones, Now pride is coumfortid, and chastisyng, and tyme of distruccioun, and the wraththe of indignacioun.
50 Now therfor, sones, be ye sueris, `ether louyeris, of the lawe, and yyue ye youre lyues for the testament of fadris.
51 And bithenke ye on werkis of fadris, whiche thei diden in her generaciouns, and ye schulen resseyue greet glorie, and euerlastynge name.
52 Whether in temptacioun Abraham was not founden trewe, and it was arettid to hym to riytwisnes?
53 Joseph in time of his angwisch kepte comaundement, and was maad lord of Egipt.
54 Fynees, oure fadir, in feruentli louynge the feruent loue of God, took testament of euerlastynge preesthod.
55 Jhesus, `ether Josue, while he fillide the word, was maad duyk in Israel.
56 Caleph, while he witnesside in the chirche, took eritage.
57 Dauid in his merci gat the sete of kyngdom, in to worldis.
58 Elie, while he feruentli louyde the feruent loue of the lawe, was resseyued in to heuene.
59 Ananyas, Azarias, Misael, bileuyden, and weren delyuered fro flawme.
60 Danyel in his symplenesse was delyuered fro the mouth of liouns.
61 And thus bithenke ye bi generacioun and generacioun, for alle that hopen in to hym ben not maad vnstidefast.
62 And drede ye not of the wordis of a man synnere, for the glorie of hym is tord and worm;
63 to dai he is enhaunsid, and to morewe he schal not be foundun, for he is turned in to his erthe, and his thouyt schal perische.
64 Therfor, ye sones, be coumfortid, and do ye manli in the lawe; for whanne ye schulen do tho thingis that ben bodun to you in the lawe of youre Lord God, in it ye schulen be gloriouse.
65 And lo! Symount, youre brother; Y woot, that he is a man of councel, here ye hym eueremore, and he schal be fadir to you.
66 And Judas Machabeus, stronge in miytis fro his yongthe, be to you a prince in knyythod, and he schal do batel of the puple.
67 And ye schulen brynge to you alle doeris of the lawe, and venge ye the veniaunce of youre puple.
68 Yelde ye yeldyng to hethene men, and take ye tent to the heeste of the lawe.
69 And he blesside hem, and was put to hise fadris.
70 And he was deed in the hundrid and `sixe and fourti yeer, and was biried of hise sones in to sepulcre of hise fadris in Modyn; and al Israel weiliden hym with greet weilyng.

CAP 3
1 And Judas, that was clepid Machabeus, the sone of Matatias, roos for hym.
2 And alle hise britheren helpiden hym, and alle that ioyneden hem to his fadir, and thei fouyten the batel `of Israel with gladnesse.
3 And he alargide glorie to his puple, and clothide hym with an haburiowne as a giaunt, and girde hym with hise armeris of batel in batels, and defendide castels with his swerd.
4 He was maad lijk a lioun in hise werkis, and as a whelp of lioun rorynge in his huntyng.
5 And he pursuede wickid men, and souyte hem; and he brente hem in flawmes, that disturbliden his puple.
6 And hise enemyes weren put abac for drede of hym, and alle worcheris of wickidnesse weren troblid to gidere; and heelthe was dressid in his hond.
7 And he wraththide many kyngis, and gladide Jacob in hise werkis, and in to world his mynde is in blessyng.
8 And he wente thorouy the citees of Juda, and loste vnpitouse men of hem, and turnede awei wraththe fro Israel.
9 And he was named til to the vtmest of erthe, and he gaderide men perischynge.
10 And Appollyne gaderide folkis, and fro Samarie myche vertu, and greet, for to fiyte ayens Israel.
11 And Judas knew, and wente out ayens hym, and smoot, and slow hym. And many woundid fellen doun, and the othere fledden; and he took preies of hem.
12 And Judas took awei the swerd of Appollyne, and was fiytynge therwith in alle daies.
13 And Seron, prince of the oost of Sirie, herde, that Judas gaderide a gaderyng, and the chirche of feithful men with hym.
14 And he seide, Y schal make to me a name, and Y schal be glorified in the rewme, and Y schal ouercome Judas, and hem that ben with hym, whiche dispisiden the kyngis word.
15 And he made redi hym; and the castels of vnpitouse men, stronge helperis, stieden vp with hym, for to do veniaunce on the sones of Israel.
16 And thei neiyiden `til to Betheron; and Judas wente out ayens hem, with fewe men.
17 Forsothe as thei siyen the oost comynge to hem in metinge, thei seiden to Judas, Hou moun we fewe fiyten ayens so greet multitude, so strong; and we ben maad weri bi fastyng this dai?
18 And Judas seide, It is liyt, `ether esy, that many be closid togidere in hond of fewe; and difference is not in siyt of God `of heuene, for to delyuere in manye ether in fewe;
19 for not in multitude of oost is the victorie of batel, but of heuene is strengthe.
20 Thei comen to vs in rebel multitude, and pride, for to distrie vs, and oure wyues, and oure sones, and for to robbe vs.
21 Forsothe we schulen fiyte for oure lyues, and oure lawis;
22 and the Lord hym silf schal al to-breke hem bifore oure face; forsothe drede ye not hem.
23 Sotheli as he ceesside for to speke, he hurlide in `in to hem sudenli; and Seron was al to-brokun, and his oost, in the siyt of hym.
24 And he pursuede hym in the goynge doun of Betheron, til in to the feeld; and eiyte hundrid men of hem fellen doun, the othere forsothe fledden in to the lond of Filistiym.
25 And the drede of Judas, and of his britheren, and the inward ferdnesse, felle on alle hethene men in cumpas of hem;
26 and the name of hym cam to the kyng, and alle folkis telden of the bateils of Judas.
27 Sotheli as king Antiok herde these wordis, he was wrooth in soule; and he sente, and gaderide the oost of al his rewme, ful stronge castels.
28 And he openyde his treserie, and yaf sowdis to the oost, in to a yeer, and comaundide hem, that thei schulden be redi to alle thingis.
29 And he sai, that money failide of hise tresouris, and tributis of the cuntrei weren litil, for dissencioun and veniaunce that he dide in the lond, for to do awei the lawful thingis that weren of the firste daies.
30 And he dredde, that he schulde not haue as onys and twies in to costis and yiftis, whiche he hadde youun bifore with large hond; and he was riche ouer kingis that weren bifore hym.
31 And he was astonyed in soule greetli, and thouyte for to go in to Persis, and for to take tributis of cuntreis, and for to gadre myche siluer.
32 And he lefte Lisias, a noble man of the kyngis kyn, on the kingis nedis, fro the flood Eufrates til to the flood of Egipt;
33 and that he schulde nursche Antiok, his sone, til he cam ayen.
34 And he bitook to hym the half of the oost, and olifauntis, and comaundide to hym of alle these thingis that he wolde, and of men enhabitynge Judee and Jerusalem;
35 and that he schulde sende to hem an oost, for to al to-breke, and to distrie vttirly the vertu of Israel, and relifs of Jerusalem, and for to do awey the mynde of hem fro place;
36 and for to ordeyne dwelleris sones aliens in alle the coostis of hem, and bi lot for to departe the lond of hem.
37 And the kyng took a part of the residue oost, and wente out of Antiochie, citee of his rewme, in the hundrid and seuene and fourti yeer; and passide ouer the flood Eufrates, and wente thorou the hiyere cuntreis.
38 And Lisias chees Tholome, the sone of Dorym, and Nycanore, and Gorgie, miyti men of the kyngis frendis.
39 And he sente with hem fourti thousynde of men, and seuene thousynde of hors men, `ether knyytis, that thei schulden come in to the lond of Juda, and distrie it, bi the word of the kyng.
40 And thei wenten forth, for to go with al her pouer; and thei camen, and londiden at Ammaum, in the feeldi lond.
41 And marchauntis of cuntreis herden the name of hem, and token siluer and gold ful miche, and children, and camen in to castels, for to take the sones of Israel in to seruauntis; and the oostes of Sirie and the londis of aliens weren addid to hem.
42 And Judas siy, and his britheren, that yuelis weren multiplied, and the oost appliede, `ether londide, at the coostis of hem; and thei knewen the wordis of the kyng, whiche he comaundide the puple for to do, in to perischyng and endyng.
43 And thei seiden, ech man to his neiybore, Reise we the castyng doun of oure puple, and fiyte we for oure puple, and oure hooli thingis.
44 And comyng togidere of oost was gaderid, for to be redi in to batel, and for to preie, and axe merci, and merciful doyngis.
45 And Jerusalem was not enhabitid, but was as desert; ther was not that entride and wente out, of children therof; and the hooli thing was defoulid, and sones of aliens weren in the hiy tour, ther was the dwellyng of hethene men; and the likyng was don awei fro Jacob, and pipe and harpe failide there.
46 And thei weren gaderid, and camen in to Masphat ayens Jerusalem; for place of preier was in Masphat, sunnere than in Jerusalem.
47 And thei fastiden in that dai, and clothiden hem with hairis, and puttiden aisch in her heed, and renten her clothis.
48 And thei spredden abrood bookis of lawe, of the whiche hethene men souyten licnesse of her symylacris;
49 and thei brouyten ournementis of prestis, and `firste fruytis, and tithis; and thei reisiden Nazareis that hadden fillid daies.
50 And thei crieden with greet vois to heuene, and seiden, What schulen we do to these, and whidur schulen we lede hem?
51 And thin hooli thingis ben to-trodun, and defoulid, and thi prestis ben maad in to mourenyng,
52 and in to dispisyng. And lo! naciouns camen togidere ayens vs, for to distrie vs; thou wost what thingis thei thenken ayens vs.
53 Hou schulen we mow withstonde bifore the face of hem, no but thou, God, helpe vs?
54 And thei crieden in trumpis, with greet vois.
55 And aftir these thingis Judas ordeynede duykis of the puple, tribunes, and centuriouns, and pentacontrarkis, and decuriouns.
56 And he seide to these that bildiden housis, and wediden wyues, and plauntiden vyne yerdis, and to dredeful men, that thei schulden turne ayen, eche man in to his hous, bi the lawe.
57 And thei mouyden castels, and thei settiden togidere at the south of Ammaum.
58 And Judas seide, Be ye gird, and be ye miyti sones, and be ye redi `in the morewnyng, and that ye fiyte ayens these naciouns, that camen togidere for to distrie vs, and oure hooli thingis.
59 For betere is, that we die in batel, than for to se yuels of oure folc and holi thingis.
60 Sotheli as wille schal be in heuene, so be it don.

CAP 4
1 And Gorgias took fyue thousynde of men, and a thousynde chosun horse men; and thei mouyden tentis bi niyt,

33 Forsothe Symount wente out, and cam til to Ascalon, and to the nexte strengthis; and he bowide doun in to Joppe, and ocupiede it.
34 For he herde, that thei wolden yyue help to partis of Demetrie; and he puttide there keperis, for to kepe it.
35 And Jonathas turnede ayen, and clepide togidere the eldere men of the puple, and thouyte with hem for to bilde strengthis in Judee,

37 And thei camen togidere, for to bilde the citee. And the wal felle doun togidere, that was on the streem, fro the risyng of the sunne; and he reparalide it, that is clepid Cafeteta.
38 And Symount bildide Adiada in Sephela, and strengthide it, and puttide on yatis and lockis.
39 And whanne Trifon thouyte for to regne at Asie, and take a diademe, and stretche out hond in to Antiok kyng,
40 he dredde, lest perauenture Jonathas schulde not suffre hym, but fiyte ayens hym; and he souyte for to catche hym, and sle.
41 And he roos vp, and wente in to Bethsan. And Jonathas wente out ayens hym, with fourti thousynde of chosun men in to batel, and cam to Bethsan.
42 And Trifon siy, that Jonathas cam with myche oost, for to stretche out hondis in to hym.

44 And he seide to Jonathas, Wherto hast thou trauelid al the puple, whanne batel is not to vs?
45 And now sende ayen hem in to her housis. But chese thou to thee a fewe men, that ben with thee, and come thou with me to Tolomayda, and Y schal yyue it to thee, and other strengthis, and oost, and alle souereyns of offices; and Y schal turne, and Y schal go awei. For whi therfor Y cam.

47 Forsothe he withhelde with hym thre thousynde of men, of whiche he sente ayen in to Galilee two thousynde; sotheli a thousynde cam with hym.
48 Forsothe as Jonathas entride in to Tolomaida, men of Tolomaida schittiden the yatis, and cauyten hym; and slowen bi swerd alle that entriden with hym.
49 And Trifon sente oost, and horse men in to Galilee, and in to the greet feeld, for to leese alle the felowis of Jonathas.

CAP 13
1 And as Symount herde, that Trifon gaderide a greet oost, for to come in to the lond of Juda,
2 and for to distrie it, and siy that the puple was in tremblyng and drede, he stiy vp to Jerusalem, and gaderide the puple;
3 and monestide, and seide, Ye witen, hou grete thingis Y, and my britheren, and the hous of my fadir, han do, for lawis, and for hooli thingis, batels, and what maner angwischis we saien.
4 For loue of these thingis alle my britheren perischiden for Israel, and Y aloone am left.
5 And now bifalle it not to me, for to spare my lijf in al the tyme of tribulacioun; for Y am not betere than my britheren.
6 Therfor Y schal venge my folc, and hooli thingis, and oure children, and wyues; for alle hethene men ben gaderid, for to distrie vs, bi cause of enemyte.
7 And the spirit of the puple was kyndlid togidere, as it herde these wordis.
8 And thei answeriden with greet vois, seiynge, Thou art oure duyk in stide of Judas, and Jonathas, thi brother; fiyte thou oure batel,
9 and alle thingis what euere thou schalt seie to vs, we schulen do.
10 And he gaderide alle men fiyteris, and hastide for to ende alle wallis of Jerusalem, and strengthide it in cumpas.
11 And he sente Jonathas, the sone of Absolomy, and with hym a newe oost, in to Joppe. And whanne he hadde put out these men that weren in it, he dwelte there.
12 And Trifon mouyde fro Tolomaida with myche oost, for to come in to the lond of Juda, and Jonathas with hym in kepyng.
13 Forsothe Symount appliede in Addus, ayens the face of the feeld.
14 And as Trifon knew, that Symount roos in the stide of his brother Jonathas, and that he was to ioynynge batel with hym, he sente to hym legatis,
15 and seide, For siluer, that thi brother Jonatas ouyte in acountis of the kyng, we withhelden hym.
16 And nowe sende thou an hundrid talentis of siluer, and hise twei sones pleggis, that he not dismyttid fle fro vs, and we schulen ayensende hym.
17 And Symount knew, that with gile he spak with hym. Netheles he comaundide the siluer for to be youun, and children, leste he schulde take grete enemytee at the puple of Israel, seiynge, For he sente not to hym siluer and children,
18 therfor he perischide.
19 And he sente the children, and an hundrid talentis. And he liede, and dismyttide not Jonathas.
20 And after these thingis Trifon cam with ynne the cuntre, for to distrie it. And thei cumpassiden bi the weie that ledith to Ador; and Symount and his oost walkiden in to ech place, whidur euere thei wenten.
21 Sotheli thei that weren in the hiy tour, senten legatis to Trifon, for to haste to come bi desert, and sende to hem foodis.
22 And Trifon made redi al the multitude of horse men, for to come in that nyyt. Sotheli ther was ful myche snow, and he cam not in to Galadithym.
23 And whanne he neiyede to Baschama, he slow Jonathas and hise sones there.
24 And Trifon turnede, and wente in to his lond.
25 And Symount sente, and took the boonus of Jonathas, his brother, and biride tho in Modyn, the citee of hise fadris.
26 And al Israel biweiliden hym with greet weilyng, and thei bymourenyde hym many daies.
27 And Symount bildide on the sepulcre of his fadir and hise britheren an hiy bildyng in siyt, with stoon polischid bihynde and bifore.
28 And he ordeynede seuene smale bildyngis, brood bynethe and scharp aboue, oon ayens oon, to fadir, and modir, and foure britheren.
29 And to these he puttide aboute grete pilers, and on the pileris armeris, to euerlastynge mynde; and bisidis armeris schippis grauun, whiche schulden be seyn of men seilynge in the see.
30 This is the sepulcre that Symount maad in Modyn, til in to this day.
31 Forsothe whanne Trifon made weie with Antiok, the yonge kyng, in gile he slow hym, and regnyde in his stide;
32 and puttide on hym the diademe of Asie, and made greet veniaunce in the lond.
33 And Symount bildide strengthis of Judee, and wardide hem with hiy touris, and grete wallis, and yatis, and lockis; and puttide foodis in strengthingis.
34 And Symount chees men, and sente to kyng Demetrie, that he schulde make remyssioun to the cuntree, for alle dedis of Trifon weren don bi rauyschyng.
35 And kyng Demetrie answeride to hym to these wordis, and wroot suche epistle.
36 Kyng Demetrie to Symount, hiyeste prest, and frend of kyngis, and to the eldere men, and folc of Jewis, heelthe.
37 We resseyueden the goldun coroun, and baheu, which ye senten, and ben redi for to make with you greet pees, and for to write to prepostis of the kyng, for to releesse to you what thingis we foryauen;
38 for what euere thingis we ordeynen to you, ben stable. The strengthis that ye bildiden, be to you; and we forgyuen ignorances and synnes,
39 til in to this dai, and the coroun that ye ouyten; and if ony other thing was tributarie in Jerusalem, now be it not tributarie.
40 And if ony of you ben able for to be writun togidere among oure men, be thei writun togidere, and pees be bitwixe vs.
41 In the hundrid yeer and seuentithe, the yok of hethene men was takun awei fro Israel.
42 And the puple began for to write in tablis, and comyn doyngis, in the firste yeer vndur Symount, hiyeste prest, greet duyk, and prince of Jewis.
43 In tho daies Symount appliede to Gasan, and enuyrownyde it with tentis, and made engines, and appliede to the citee, and smoot o tour, and took it.
44 And thei that braken out, weren with ynne the engyne in the cite, and greet stiryng was maad in the cite.
45 And thei stieden vp, that weren in the cite, with her wyues, and sones, on the wal, with her cootis kit, and crieden with greet vois axynge of Symount that riythondis be youun to hem,
46 and seiden, Yelde thou not to vs bi oure malices, but bi thi mercies, and we schulen serue to thee.
47 And Symount was bowid, and fauyt not ayens hem; netheles he castide hem out of the citee, and clenside fulli the housis in whiche weren symylacris, and thanne he entride in to it with ympnes, and blesside the Lord.
48 And whanne alle vnclennesse was caste out therof, he settide therynne men, that schulden do the lawe; and he strengthide it, and made an abitacioun to him.
49 Forsothe thei that weren in the hiy tour of Jerusalem, weren forbodun for to go out and go yn, in to the cuntre, and bie, and sille; and thei hungriden greetli, and many of hem perischiden for hungur.
50 And thei crieden to Symount, for to take riyt hondis, and he yaf to hem; and he castide out hem fro thennus, and clenside the hiy tour fro defoulingis.
51 And thei entriden in to it in thre and twentithe dai of the secounde monethe, in the hundrid and oon and seuenty yeer, with heriyng, and braunchis of palmes, and instrumentis of musik, `ether giternys, and cymbalis, and harpis, and ympnys, and songis, for the greet enemye of Israel was al to-brokun.
52 And he ordeynede, that in alle yeeris these daies schulden be don with gladnesse.
53 And he strengthide the hil of the temple, that was bisidis the hiy tour, and dwelte there, he, and thei that weren with hym.
54 And Symount siy Joon, his sone, that he was a man of batel, and he puttide hym duyk of alle vertues, and he dwelte in Gasaris.

CAP 14
1 In the hundrid and two and seuenti yeer kyng Demetrie gaderide his oost, and wente to Medei, for to drawe togidere helpis to hym, for to ouercome Trifon.
2 And as Arsases, kyng of Persis and Medei, herde that Demetrie entride in to his niy coostis, he sente oon of hise princes, for to take hym quyk, and that he schulde brynge hym to hym silf.
3 And he wente, and smoot tentis, `ether oost, of Demetrie, and took hym, and ledde hym to Arsaces, and he puttide hym in to kepyng.
4 And the lond of Juda was pesible in alle daies of Symount, and he souyte goode thingis of his folc; and his power and his glorie pleside to hem in alle daies.
5 And with al his glorie he took Joppe in to hauene, and made entre in to ilis of the see;
6 and alargide the coostis of his puple, and weldide the cuntre.
7 And he gaderide myche caitifte, and was lord in Gasara, and Bethsura, and the hiy tour; and dide awei vnclennessis of it, and ther was not that ayenstood hym.
8 And ech man tilide his owne lond with pees, and the lond of Juda yaf hise fruitis, and trees of feeldis her fruitis.
9 Eldere men saten alle in stretis, and tretiden of goodis of the lond; and yonge men clothiden hem in glorie, and in stoolis of batel.
10 And to the citees he yaf foodis, and ordeynede tho, that tho weren vessels of strengthing, til that the name of his glorie was named til to the laste of erthe.
11 He made pees on the lond, and Israel was glad with greet gladnesse;
12 and ech man sat vndur his vyne, and vndur his fige tree, nether ther was that feeride hem.
13 The fiytynge man ayens hem failide on erthe; kyngis weren al to-brokun in tho daies.
14 And he confermyde alle meke men of his puple, and he souyte out the lawe, and dide awei al yuel and wickidnesse;

16 And it was herd at Rome, that Jonathas was deed, and til in to Sparciatis, and thei weren ful soreuful.
17 Forsothe as thei herden, that Symount, his brother, was maad hiyeste preest in his stide, and he weldide the cuntre, and citees in it,

19 and thei weren rad in the siyt of the chirche in Jerusalem. And this is ensaumple of pistlis, that Sparciatis senten.
20 The prince and citees of Sparciatis to Symount, greet prest, and to the eldere men, and prestis, and to othere puple of Jewis, britheren, heelthe.
21 Legatis that weren sente to oure puple, telden to vs of youre glorie, and onour, and gladnesse, and we ioieden in the entree of hem.
22 And we han write what thingis weren seid of hem in councels of puple, thus. Numenyus, the sone of Antiok, and Antipater, the sone of Jason, legatis of Jewis, camen to vs, and renulide with vs the formere frendschip.
23 And it pleside to the puple, for to resseyue the men gloriousli, and to putte ensaumple of her wordis in departid bookis of the puple, that it be to mynde to the puple of Sparciatis; forsothe we han write ensaumple of these thingis to Symount, the greet preest.
24 Forsothe aftir these thingis Symount sente Numenyus to Rome, hauynge a greet goldun scheeld, in weiyte of a thousynde besauntis, for to ordeyne felouschip with hem. Sotheli whanne the puple of Rome herde these wordis,
25 thei seiden, What doyng of thankyngis schulen we yelde to Symount, and his sones?
26 For he restoride his britheren, and ouercam the enemyes of Israel fro hem. And thei ordeyneden to hym liberte, and writiden in brasun tablis, and Jewis puttiden in titlis, in the mount of Sion.
27 And this is ensaumple of writyng. In the eiytenthe dai of the monethe Ebul, in the hundrid and two and seuenti yeer, the thridde yeer vndur Symount, greet preest, in Asaramael,
28 in the greet comyng togidere of prestis, of the puple, and princis, and folc, and `eldere men of the cuntre, these thingis weren maad knowun; for many tymes batels weren don in youre cuntre.
29 Forsothe Symount, the sone of Matatias, of the sones of Jarib, and his britheren, yauen hem silf to perel, and ayenstoden aduersaries of her folc, that her hooli thingis and lawe schulde stonde; and bi greet glorye thei glorifieden her folc.
30 And Jonathas gaderide his folc, and was maad to hem a greet preest, and is put to his puple.
31 And the enemyes of hem wolden defoule holi thingis, and distrie the cuntre of hem, and stretche forth hond in to hooli thingis `of hem.
32 Thanne Symount ayenstood, and fauyt for his puple, and yaf many richessis, and armyd men of vertu of his folc, and yaf to hem sowdis;
33 and strengthide the citees of Juda, and Bethsura, that was in the endis of Judee, where bifor weren armeris of enemyes, and he puttide there help, men of Jewis.
34 And he strengthide Joppe, that was at the see, and Gasara, that was in coostis of Asotus, in which enemyes dwelten bifore; and he settide there Jewis, and what euere thingis weren able to amendyng of hem, he puttede in hem.
35 And the puple siy the doyng of Symount, and glorie that he thouyte `for to do to his folc, and thei maden hym her duyk, and prince of preestis, for that he hadde don alle these thingis, and riytwisnesse, and feith that he kepte to his folc; and he souyte out in al maner for to raise hys puple.
36 And in hise daies it hadde prosperite in his hondis, that hethene men weren takun awei fro the cuntre of hem, whiche weren in the citee of Dauid in Jerusalem, in the hiy tour; fro which thei camen out, and defouliden alle thingis that weren in cumpas of hooli thingis, and yauen greet wounde to chastite.
37 And he settide ther ynne men Jewis, to defendyng of the cuntre and citee, and reiside the wallis in Jerusalem.
38 And kyng Demetrie ordeynede to hym the hiyeste presthod;
39 bi this he made him his frend, and glorifiede hym in greet glorie.
40 For he herde, that Jewis weren clepid of Romayns frendis, and felowis, and britheren, and that thei resseyueden legatis of Symount gloriousli;
41 and that Jewis, and prestis of hem, consentiden, him for to be her duyk, and hiyeste preest with outen ende, til ther rise a feithful profete;
42 and that he be duyk on hem, and cure were to him for hooli thingis; and that he schulde ordeyne gouernouris on the werkis of hem, and on the cuntre, and on armeris, and on strengthis;
43 and cure be to hym of hooli thingis; and that he be herd of men, and alle writyngis in the cuntre be writun togidere vndur name of hym; and that he be keuered with purpur and gold;
44 and that it be not leueful to ony of the puple, and to prestis, for to make ony thing of these voide, and ayenseie to these thingis that ben seid of hym, ether for to clepe togidere couent in the cuntre with outen hym; and for to be clothid in purpur, and for to vse a goldun lace, `ether noche.
45 Sotheli he that schal do with out this, ether schal make voide ony of these, schal be gilti.
46 And it pleside togidere to al the puple, for to ordeyne Symount, and do bi these wordis.
47 And Symount resseyuede, and it pleside hym, that he schulde vse hiyeste preesthod, and be duyk and prince of the folc of Jewis, and prestis, and be souereyn of alle men.
48 And thei ordeyneden for to put this writyng in brasun tablis, and put hem in the wal aboute the cumpassyng of hooli thingis, in solempne place;
