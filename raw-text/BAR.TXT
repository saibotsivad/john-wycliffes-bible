1 And these ben the wordis of the book, which Baruk, the sone of Nerie, sone of Maasie, sone of Sedechie, sone of Sedei, sone of Helchie, wroot in Babilonye;
2 in the fyuethe yeer, in the seuenthe dai of the monethe, in the tyme wherynne Caldeis token Jerusalem, and brenten it with fier.
3 And Baruk redde the wordis of this book to the eeris of Jeconye, sone of Joachym, kyng of Juda, and to the eeris of al the puple comynge to the book;
4 and to the eeris of the myyti sones of kyngis, and to the eeris of prestis, and to the eeris of the puple, fro the mooste `til to the leeste of hem, of alle dwellynge in Babiloyne, and at the flood Sudi.
5 Whiche herden, and wepten, and fastiden, and preieden in the siyt of the Lord.
6 And thei gaderiden monei, bi that that ech mannus hond myyte;
7 and senten in to Jerusalem to Joachym, the prest, sone of Helchie, sone of Salen, and to the preestis, and to al the puple that weren foundun with hym in Jerusalem;
8 whanne he took the vessels of the temple of the Lord, that weren takun awei fro the temple, to ayen clepe in to the lond of Juda, in the tenthe dai of the monethe Siban; the siluerne vessels, which Sedechie, the kyng of Juda, the sone of Josie,
9 made, aftir that Nabugodonosor, kyng of Babiloyne, hadde take Jeconye, and princes, and alle myyti men, and the puple of the lond fro Jerusalem, and ledde hem boundun in to Babiloyne.
10 And thei seiden, Lo! we han sent to you richessis, of whiche bie ye brent sacrifices, and encense, and make ye sacrifice, and offre ye for synne at the auter of youre Lord God.
11 And preye ye for the lijf of Nabugodonosor, king of Babiloyne, and for the lijf of Balthasar, his sone, that the daies of hem ben on erthe as the daies of heuene;
12 that the Lord yyue vertu to vs, and liytne oure iyen, that we lyue vndur the schadewe of Nabugodonosor, kyng of Babiloyne, and vndur the schadewe of Balthasar, his sone; and that we serue hem bi many daies, and fynde grace in the siyt of hem.
13 And preye ye for `vs silf to our Lord God, for we han synned to oure Lord God, and his strong veniaunce is not turned awei fro vs, `til in to this dai.
14 And rede ye this book, which we senten to you, to be rehersid in the temple of the Lord, in a solempne dai, and in a couenable dai.
15 And ye schulen seie, Riytfulnesse is to oure Lord God, but schenschipe of oure face is to vs, as this dai is, to al Juda, and to dwelleris in Jerusalem,
16 to oure kyngis, and to oure princes, to oure preestis, and to oure profetis, and to oure fadris.
17 We synneden bifor oure Lord God, and bileuyden not, and tristiden not in hym.
18 And we weren not redi to be suget to hym, and we obeiden not to the vois of oure Lord God, that we yeden in hise comaundementis, whiche he yaf to vs;
19 fro the dai in which he ledde oure fadris out of the lond of Egipt, til in to this dai, we weren vnbileueful to oure Lord God; and we weren scaterid, and yeden awei, that we herden not the vois of hym.
20 And many yuels and cursyngis, whiche the Lord ordeynede to his seruaunt Moises, cleuyden to vs; which Lord ledde oure fadris out of the lond of Egipt, to yyue to vs a lond flowynge mylk and hony, as in this dai.
21 And we herden not the vois of oure Lord God, bi alle the wordis of prophetis, whiche he sente to vs, and to oure iugis;
22 and we yeden awei, ech man in to the wit of his yuel herte, to worche to alien goddis, and we diden yuels bifore the iyen of oure Lord God.

CAP 2
1 For which thing oure Lord God settide stidfastli his word, which he spak to vs, and to oure iugis, that demyden in Israel, and to oure kyngis, and to oure princes, and to al Israel and Juda;
2 that the Lord schulde brynge on vs grete yuels, that weren not don vndur heuene, as tho ben doon in Jerusalem; bi tho thingis that ben writun in the lawe of Moises,
3 that a man schulde ete the fleischis of his sone, and the fleischis of his douyter.
4 And he yaf hem in to the hond of alle kyngis, that ben in oure cumpas, in to schenschipe, and in to desolacioun in alle puplis, among whiche the Lord scateride vs.
5 And we ben maad bynethe, and not aboue; for we synneden to oure Lord God, in not obeiynge to the vois of hym.
6 Riytfulnesse is to oure Lord God, but schenschipe of face is to vs and to oure fadris, as this dai is.
7 For the Lord spak on vs alle these yuels, that camen on vs.
8 And we bisouyten not the face of oure Lord God, that we schulden turne ayen, ech of vs fro oure worste weies.
9 And the Lord wakide in yuels, and brouyte tho on vs; for the Lord is iust in alle hise werkis, whiche he comaundide to vs.
10 And we herden not the vois of hym, that we schulden go in the comaundementis of the Lord, whiche he yaf bifore oure face.
11 And now, Lord God of Israel, that leddist thi puple out of the lond of Egipt in a strong hond, and in myraclis, and in grete wondris, and in thi greet vertu, and in an hiy arm, and madist to thee a name, as this dai is;
12 we han synned, we han do vnfeithfuli, we han do wickidli, oure Lord God, in alle thi riytfulnessis.
13 Thi wrath be turned awey fro vs; for we ben left a fewe among hethene men, where thou scateridist vs.
14 Lord, here thou oure axyngis, and oure preyeris, and lede vs out for thee; and yyue thou to vs to fynde grace bifore the face of hem, that ledden vs awei;
15 that al erthe knowe, that thou art oure Lord God, and that thi name is clepid to help on Israel, and on the kyn of hym.
16 Lord, bihold thou fro thin hooli hous on vs, and bouwe doun thin eere, and here vs.
17 Opene thin iyen, and se; for not deed men that ben in helle, whos spirit is takun fro her entrails, schulen yyue onour and iustefiyng to the Lord;
18 but a soule which is sori on the greetnesse of yuel, and goith bowid, and sijk, and iyen failynge, and an hungri soule, yyueth glorie to thee, and riytfulnesse to the Lord.
19 For not bi the riytfulnesses of oure fadris we `scheden merci bifore thi siyt, oure Lord God;
20 but for thou sentist thi wraththe and thi stronge veniaunce on vs, as thou spakest in the hondis of thi children profetis,
21 and seidist, Thus seith the Lord, Bowe ye youre schuldur, and youre necke, and do ye trauel to the kyng of Babiloyne; and ye schulen sitte in the lond, which Y yaf to youre fadris.
22 That if ye don not, nethir heren the vois of youre Lord God, to worche to the kyng of Babiloyne, Y schal make youre failyng fro the citees of Juda, and fro the yatis of Jerusalem;
23 and Y schal take awei fro you the vois of gladnesse, and the vois of ioye, and the vois of spouse, and the vois of spousesse; and al the lond schal be with out step of hem that dwellen therynne.
24 And thei herden not thi vois, that thei schulden worche to the kyng of Babiloyne; and thou hast set stidfastli thi wordis, whiche thou spakist in the hondis of thi children, prophetis; that the boonys of oure kyngis, and the boonys of oure fadris schulen be borun ouer fro her place.
25 And lo! tho ben cast forth in the heete of the sunne, and in the frost of niyt; and men ben deed in the worste sorewis, in hungur, and in swerd, and in sending out.
26 And thou hast set the temple in which thi name was clepid to help, as this dai schewith, for the wickidnesse of the hous of Israel, and of the hous of Juda.
27 And thou, oure Lord God, hast do in vs bi al thi goodnesse, and bi al that greet merciful doyng of thee,
28 as thou spakest in the hond of thi child Moises, in the dai in which thou comaundidist to hym to write thi lawe bifore the sones of Israel, and seidist,
29 If ye heren not my vois, this greet ournyng and myche schal be turned in to the leest among hethene men, whidur Y schal scatere hem.
30 For Y woot, that the puple schal not here me, for it is a puple of hard nol. And it schal turne to her herte in the lond of her caitiftee;
31 and thei schulen wite, that Y am the Lord God of hem. And Y schal yyue to hem an herte, and thei schulen vndurstonde, and eeris, and thei schulen here.
32 And thei schulen herie me in the lond of her caitiftee, and thei schulen be myndeful of my name.
33 Thei schulen turne awei hem silf fro her hard bak, and fro her wickidnessis; for thei schulen haue mynde of the wei of her fadris, that synneden ayens me.
34 And Y schal ayen clepe hem in to the lond, which Y swoor to yyue to the fadris of hem, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and thei schulen be lordis of it. And Y schal multiplie hem, and thei schulen not be maad lesse.
35 And Y schal ordeyne to hem an other testament euerlastynge, that Y be to hem in to God, and thei schulen be to me in to a puple. And Y schal no more moue my puple, the sones of Israel, fro the lond which Y yaf to hem.
1 And now, Lord almiyti, God of Israel, a soule in angwischis and a spirit anoied crieth to thee.
2 Lord, here thou, and haue merci, for thou art merciful God; and haue thou merci on vs, for we han synned bifor thee,
3 that sittist withouten ende, and we schulen not perische withouten ende.
4 Lord God almiyti, God of Israel, here thou now the preier of the deed men of Israel, and of the sones of hem, that synneden bifor thee, and herden not the vois of her Lord God, and yuels ben fastned to vs.
5 Nyle thou haue mynde on the wickidnesse of oure fadris, but haue thou mynde on thin hond and on thi name in this tyme;
6 for thou art oure Lord God, and, Lord, we schulen herie thee.
7 For whi for this thing thou hast youe thi drede in oure hertis, that we clepe thi name to help, and herie thee in oure caitiftee; for we schulen be conuertid fro the wickidnesse of oure fadris, that synneden ayens thee.
8 And lo! we ben in oure caitifte to dai, whidur thou scateridist vs, in to schenschipe, and in to cursyng, and in to synne, bi al the wickidnesse of oure fadris, that yeden awei fro thee, thou oure Lord God.

CAP 3
9 Israel, here thou the comaundementis of lijf; perseyue thou with eeris, that thou kunne prudence.
10 Israel, what is it, that thou art in the lond of enemyes?
11 Thou wexidist eld in an alien lond, thou art defoulid with deed men, thou art arettid with hem, that goon doun in to helle?
12 Thou hast forsake the welle of wisdom;
13 for whi if thou haddist gon in the weies of God, sotheli thou haddist dwellid in pees on erthe.
14 Lerne thou, where is wisdom, where is prudence, where is vertu, where is vndurstondyng, that thou wite togidere, where is long duryng of lijf and lijf lode, where is liyt of iyen, and pees.
15 Who foond the place therof, and who entride in to the tresouris therof?
16 Where ben the princes of hethene men, and that ben lordis ouer the beestis, that ben on erthe?
17 Whiche pleien with the briddis of heuene;
18 whiche tresoren siluer and gold, in which men tristen, and noon ende is of the purchasyng of hem? Which maken siluer, and ben busi, and no fyndyng is of her werkis?
19 Thei ben distried, and yeden doun to hellis; and othere men riseden in the place of hem.
20 The yonge men of hem sien liyt, `and dwelliden on erthe. But thei knewen not the weie of wisdom, nether vndurstoden the pathis therof;
21 nether the sones of hem resseyueden it. It was maad fer fro the face of hem;
22 it is not herd in the lond of Canaan, nether is seyn in Theman.
23 Also the sones of Agar, that souyten out prudence which is of erthe, the marchauntis of erthe, and of Theman, and the tale telleris, and sekeris out of prudence and of vndurstondyng. But thei knewen not the weie of wisdom, nether hadden mynde on the paththis therof.
24 O! Israel, the hous of God is ful greet, and the place of his possessioun is greet;
25 it is greet and hath noon ende, hiy and greet without mesure.
26 Namyd giauntis weren there; thei that weren of greet stature at the bigynnyng, and knewen batel.
27 The Lord chees not these, nether thei founden the weie of wisdom; therfor thei perischiden.
28 And for thei hadden not wisdom, thei perischiden for her vnwisdom.
29 Who stiede in to heuene, and took that wisdom, and brouyte it doun fro the cloudis?
30 Who passide ouer the see, and foond it, and brouyte it more than chosun gold?
31 Noon is, that mai knowe the weie therof, nethir that sekith the pathis therof;
32 but he that han alle thingis, knewe it, and foond it bi his prudence. Which made redi the erthe in euerlastynge tyme, and fillide it with twei footid beestis, and foure footid beestis.
33 Which sendith out liyt, and it goith, and clepide it; and it obeieth to hym in tremblyng.
34 Forsothe sterris yauen liyt in her kepyngis, and weren glad;
35 tho weren clepid, and tho seiden, We ben present; and tho schyneden to hym with mirthe, that made tho.
36 This is oure God, and noon other schal be gessid ayens hym.
37 This foond ech weie of wisdom, and yaf it to Jacob, his child, and to Israel, his derlyng.
38 Aftir these thingis he was seyn in londis, and lyuede with men.

CAP 4
1 This book of Goddis heestis, and the lawe which is withouten ende. Alle that holden it, schulen come to lijf. But thei that han forsake it, schulen come in to deth.
2 Jacob, be thou conuertid, and take thou it; go thou bi the weie at the briytnesse therof, ayens the liyt therof. Yyue thou not thi glorie to another, and thi dignyte to an alien folc. Israel, we ben blessid; for tho thingis that plesen God, ben open to vs.
5 The puple of God, Israel worthi to be had in mynde, be thou `of betere coumfort.
6 Ye ben seeld to hethene men, not in to perdicioun; but for that that ye in ire terreden God to wrathfulnesse, ye ben bitakun to aduersaries.
7 For ye wraththiden thilke God euerlastynge, that made you; and ye offriden to fendis, and not to God.
8 For ye foryaten hym that nurschide you, and ye maden sori youre nurse, Jerusalem.
9 For it siy wrathfulnesse of God comynge to you, and it seide, Ye niy coostis of Sion, here; forsothe God hath brouyte greet morenyng to me.
10 For Y siy the caitiftee of my puple, of my sones and douytris, which he that is with out bigynnyng and ende brouyte on hem.
11 For Y nurschide hem with myrthe; but Y lefte hem with wepyng and morenyng.
12 No man haue ioye on me, a wedewe and desolat. Y am forsakun of manye for the synnes of my sones; for thei bowiden awei fro the lawe of God.
13 Forsothe thei knewen not `the riytfulnessis of hym; nether thei yeden bi the weies of Goddis heestis, nether bi the pathis of his treuthe thei entriden with riytfulnesse.
14 The niy coostis of Sion come, and haue thei mynde on the caitifte of my sones and douytris, which he that is with out bigynnyng and ende brouyte on hem.
15 For he brouyte on hem a folk fro fer, an yuel folk, and of an other langage;
16 that reuerensiden not an eld man, nether hadden merci on children; and thei ledden awei the dereworthe sones of a widewe, and maden a womman aloone desolat of sones.
17 But what mai Y helpe you?
18 For he that brouyte on you yuels, shal delyuer you fro the hondis of youre enemyes.
19 Go ye, sones, go ye; for Y am forsakun aloone. Y haue vnclothid me of the stoole of pees; but Y haue clothid me with a sak of bisechyng, and Y schal crie to the hiyeste in my daies.
21 Sones, be ye of betere comfort; crie ye to the Lord, and he schal delyuere you fro the hond of princes, that ben youre enemyes.
22 For Y hopide youre helthe with outen ende, and ioye cam to me fro the hooli on merci, that schal come to you fro youre sauyour without bigynnyng and ende.
23 For Y sente you out with mourenyng and wepyng; but God schal brynge you ayen to me with ioye and myrthe with outen ende.
24 For as the neiyboressis of Sion sien youre caitifte maad of God, so thei schulen se and in swiftnesse youre helthe of God, which helthe schal come to you fro aboue with greet onour and euerlastynge schynyng.
25 Sones, suffre ye pacientli ire, that cam on you; for thin enemy pursuede thee, but thou schalt se soone the perdicioun of hym, and thou schalt stie on the neckes of hym.
26 My delicat men yeden scharp weies; for thei as a floc `that is rauyschid weren led of enemyes.
27 Sones, be ye pacientere, and crie ye fer to the Lord; for whi youre mynde schal be of hym that ledith you.
28 For as youre wit was, that ye erriden fro God, ye schulen conuerte eft, and schulen seke hym tensithis so myche.
29 For he that brouyte in yuels to you, schal brynge eft euerlastynge myrthe to you with youre helthe.
30 Jerusalem, be thou of betere coumfort; for he that nemyde thee, excitith thee.
31 Thei that traueliden thee, schulen perische gilti; and thei that thankiden in thi fallyng, schulen be punyschid.
32 Citees to which thi sones serueden, `schulen be punyschid, and that citee that took thi sones, schal be punyschid.
33 For as Babiloyne made ioie in thi hurlyng doun, and was glad in thi fal, so it schal be maad sori in his desolacioun.
34 And the ful out ioye of the multitude therof schal be kit awei, and the ioie therof schal be in to mourenyng.
35 For whi fier schal come on it fro hym that is without bigynnyng and ende, in ful long daies; and it schal be enhabitid of fendis, in to the multitude of tyme.
36 Jerusalem, biholde aboute to the eest, and se thou myrthe comynge of God to thee.
37 For lo! thi sones comen, which thou leftist scatered; thei comen gaderid fro the eest `til to the west in the word of the hooli, and maken ioie to the onour of God.

CAP 5
1 Jerusalem, vnclothe thee of the stoole of thi mourenyng, and trauelyng; and clothe thou thee in the fairnesse, and onour of it, which is of God to thee in euerlastynge glorie.
2 God of ryytfulnesse schal cumpasse thee with a double cloth, and schal sette on thin heed a mytre of euerlastynge onour.
3 For God schal schewe his briytnesse in thee, which is vndur heuene.
4 For thi name schal be namyd of God to thee with outen ende, The pees of riytfulnesse, and the onour of pitee.
5 Jerusalem, rise vp, and stonde in an hiy place, and biholde aboute to the eest; and se thi sones gaderid togidere fro the sunne risynge til to the west in the word of the hooli, that maken ioie in the mynde of God.
6 For thei yeden out fro thee, and weren led of enemyes on feet; but the Lord schal brynge to thee hem borun in to honour, as the sones of rewme.
7 For God hath ordeyned to make low ech hiy hil, and euerlastynge rochis of stoon, and gret valeis, to fille the uneuenesse of erthe; that Israel go diligentli in to the onour of God.
8 Forsothe wodis and ech tree of swetnesse schadewiden Israel, bi the comaundement of God.
9 For God schal brynge Israel with mirthe in the liyt of his maieste, with merci and riytfulnesse, which is of hym.
