
CAP 1
1 The parablis of Salomon, the sone of Dauid, king of Israel;
2 to kunne wisdom and kunnyng;
3 to vndurstonde the wordis of prudence; and to take the lernyng of teching; to take riytfulnesse, and dom, and equyte;
4 that felnesse be youun to litle children, and kunnyng, and vndurstonding to a yong wexynge man.
5 A wise man heringe schal be wisere; and a man vndurstondinge schal holde gouernails.
6 He schal perseyue a parable, and expownyng; the wordis of wise men, and the derk figuratif spechis of hem.
7 The drede of the Lord is the bigynning of wisdom; foolis dispisen wisdom and teching.
8 My sone, here thou the teching of thi fadir, and forsake thou not the lawe of thi modir;
9 that grace be addid, ethir encreessid, to thin heed, and a bie to thi necke.
10 Mi sone, if synneris flateren thee, assente thou not to hem.
11 If thei seien, Come thou with vs, sette we aspies to blood, hide we snaris of disseitis ayens an innocent without cause;
12 swolowe we him, as helle swolowith a man lyuynge; and al hool, as goynge doun in to a lake; we schulen fynde al preciouse catel,
13 we schulen fille oure housis with spuylis; sende thou lot with vs,
14 o purs be of vs alle;
15 my sone, go thou not with hem; forbede thi foot fro the pathis of hem.
16 For the feet of hem rennen to yuel; and thei hasten to schede out blood.
17 But a net is leid in veyn bifore the iyen of briddis, that han wengis.
18 Also `thilke wickid disseyueris setten aspies ayens her owne blood; and maken redi fraudis ayens her soulis.
19 So the pathis of ech auerouse man rauyschen the soulis of hem that welden.
20 Wisdom prechith with outforth; in stretis it yyueth his vois.
21 It crieth ofte in the heed of cumpenyes; in the leeues of yatis of the citee it bringith forth hise wordis,
22 and seith, Hou long, ye litle men in wit, louen yong childhod, and foolis schulen coueyte tho thingis, that ben harmful to hem silf, and vnprudent men schulen hate kunnyng?
23 Be ye conuertid at my repreuyng; lo, Y schal profre forth to you my spirit, and Y schal schewe my wordis.
24 For Y clepide, and ye forsoken; Y helde forth myn hond, and noon was that bihelde.
25 Ye dispisiden al my councel; and chargiden not my blamyngis.
26 And Y schal leiye in youre perisching; and Y schal scorne you, whanne that, that ye dreden, cometh to you.
27 Whanne sodeyne wretchidnesse fallith in, and perisching bifallith as tempest; whanne tribulacioun and angwisch cometh on you.
28 Thanne thei schulen clepe me, and Y schal not here; thei schulen rise eerli, and thei schulen not fynde me.
29 For thei hatiden teching, and thei token not the drede of the Lord,
30 nether assentiden to my councel, and depraueden al myn amendyng.
31 Therfor thei schulen ete the fruytis of her weie; and thei schulen be fillid with her counseils.
32 The turnyng awei of litle men in wit schal sle hem; and the prosperite of foolis schal leese hem.
33 But he that herith me, schal reste with outen drede; and he schal vse abundaunce, whanne the drede of yuels is takun awei.

CAP 2
1 Mi sone, if thou resseyuest my wordis, `and hidist myn heestis anentis thee;
2 that thin eere here wisdom, bowe thin herte to knowe prudence.
3 For if thou inwardli clepist wisdom, and bowist thin herte to prudence;
4 if thou sekist it as money, and diggist it out as tresours;
5 thanne thou schalt vndirstonde the drede of the Lord, and schalt fynde the kunnyng of God.
6 For the Lord yyueth wisdom; and prudence and kunnyng is of his mouth.
7 He schal kepe the heelthe of riytful men, and he schal defende hem that goen sympli.
8 And he schal kepe the pathis of riytfulnesse, and he schal kepe the weies of hooli men.
9 Thanne thou schalt vndirstonde riytfulnesse, and dom, and equytee, and ech good path.
10 If wysdom entrith in to thin herte, and kunnyng plesith thi soule,
11 good councel schal kepe thee, and prudence schal kepe thee; that thou be delyuered fro an yuel weie,
12 and fro a man that spekith weiward thingis.
13 Whiche forsaken a riytful weie, and goen bi derk weies;
14 whiche ben glad, whanne thei han do yuel, and maken ful out ioye in worste thingis;
15 whose weies ben weywerd, and her goyingis ben of yuel fame.
16 That thou be delyuered fro an alien womman, and fro a straunge womman, that makith soft hir wordis;
17 and forsakith the duyk of hir tyme of mariage,
18 and hath foryete the couenaunt of hir God. For the hous of hir is bowid to deeth, and hir pathis to helle.
19 Alle that entren to hir, schulen not turne ayen, nether schulen catche the pathis of lijf.
20 That thou go in a good weie, and kepe the pathis of iust men.
21 Forsothe thei that ben riytful, schulen dwelle in the lond; and symple men schulen perfitli dwelle ther ynne.
22 But vnfeithful men schulen be lost fro the loond; and thei that doen wickidli, schulen be takun awey fro it.

CAP 3
1 Mi sone, foryete thou not my lawe; and thyn herte kepe my comaundementis.
2 For tho schulen sette to thee the lengthe of daies, and the yeeris of lijf, and pees.
3 Merci and treuthe forsake thee not; bynde thou tho to thi throte, and write in the tablis of thin herte.
4 And thou schalt fynde grace, and good teching bifore God and men.
5 Haue thou trist in the Lord, of al thin herte; and triste thou not to thi prudence.
6 In alle thi weies thenke thou on hym, and he schal dresse thi goyngis.
7 Be thou not wijs anentis thi silf; drede thou God, and go awei fro yuel.
8 For whi helthe schal be in thi nawle, and moisting of thi boonys.
9 Onoure thou the Lord of thi catel, and of the beste of alle thi fruytis yyue thou to pore men;
10 and thi bernes schulen be fillid with abundaunce, and pressours schulen flowe with wiyn.
11 My sone, caste thou not awei the teching of the Lord; and faile thou not, whanne thou art chastisid of him.
12 For the Lord chastisith hym, whom he loueth; and as a fadir in the sone he plesith hym.
13 Blessid is the man that fyndith wisdom, and which flowith with prudence.
14 The geting therof is betere than the marchaundie of gold and of siluer; the fruytis therof ben the firste and clenneste.
15 It is preciousere than alle richessis; and alle thingis that ben desirid, moun not be comparisound to this.
16 Lengthe of daies is in the riythalf therof, and richessis and glorie ben in the lifthalf therof.
17 The weies therof ben feire weies, and alle the pathis therof ben pesible.
18 It is a tre of lijf to hem that taken it; and he that holdith it, is blessid.
19 The Lord foundide the erthe bi wisdom; he stablischide heuenes bi prudence.
20 The depthis of watris braken out bi his wisdom; and cloudis wexen togidere bi dewe.
21 My sone, these thingis flete not awey fro thin iyen; kepe thou my lawe, and my counsel;
22 and lijf schal be to thi soule, and grace `schal be to thi chekis.
23 Thanne thou schalt go tristili in thi weie; and thi foot schal not snapere.
24 If thou schalt slepe, thou schalt not drede; thou schalt reste, and thi sleep schal be soft.
25 Drede thou not bi sudeyne feer, and the powers of wickid men fallynge in on thee.
26 For the Lord schal be at thi side; and he schal kepe thi foot, that thou be not takun.
27 Nil thou forbede to do wel him that mai; if thou maist, and do thou wel.
28 Seie thou not to thi frend, Go, and turne thou ayen, and to morewe Y schal yyue to thee; whanne thou maist yyue anoon.
29 Ymagyne thou not yuel to thi freend, whanne he hath trist in thee.
30 Stryue thou not ayens a man with out cause, whanne he doith noon yuel to thee.
31 Sue thou not an vniust man, sue thou not hise weies.
32 For ech disseyuer is abhomynacioun of the Lord; and his speking is with simple men.
33 Nedinesse is sent of the Lord in the hous of a wickid man; but the dwelling places of iust men schulen be blessid.
34 He schal scorne scorneris; and he schal yyue grace to mylde men.
35 Wise men schulen haue glorie; enhaunsing of foolis is schenschipe.

CAP 4
1 Sones, here ye the teching of the fadir; and perseiue ye, that ye kunne prudence.
2 Y schal yyue to you a good yifte; forsake ye not my lawe.
3 For whi and Y was the sone of my fadir, a tendir sone, and oon `gendride bifore my modir.
4 And my fadir tauyte me, and seide, Thin herte resseyue my wordis; kepe thou myn heestis, and thou schalt lyue.
5 Welde thou wisdom, welde thou prudence; foryete thou not, nethir bowe thou awey fro the wordis of my mouth.
6 Forsake thou not it, and it schal kepe thee; loue thou it, and it schal kepe thee.
7 The bigynnyng of wisdom, welde thou wisdom; and in al thi possessioun gete thou prudence.
8 Take thou it, and it schal enhaunse thee; thou schalt be glorified of it, whanne thou hast biclippid it.
9 It schal yyue encresyngis of graces to thin heed; and a noble coroun schal defende thee.
10 Mi sone, here thou, and take my wordis; that the yeris of lijf be multiplied to thee.
11 Y schal schewe to thee the weie of wisdom; and Y schal lede thee bi the pathis of equyte.
12 In to whiche whanne thou hast entrid, thi goyngis schulen not be maad streit; and thou schalt rennen, and schalt not haue hirtyng.
13 Holde thou teching, and forsake it not; kepe thou it, for it is thi lijf.
14 Delite thou not in the pathis of wyckid men; and the weie of yuele men plese not thee.
15 Fle thou fro it, and passe thou not therbi; bowe thou awei, and forsake it.
16 For thei slepen not, `no but thei han do yuele; and sleep is rauyschid fro hem, no but thei han disseyued.
17 Thei eten the breed of vnpite, and drinken the wyn of wickidnesse.
18 But the path of iust men goith forth as liyt schynynge, and encreessith til to perfit dai.
19 The weie of wickid men is derk; thei witen not where thei schulen falle.
20 Mi sone, herkene thou my wordis; and bowe doun thin eeris to my spechis.
21 Go not tho awei fro thyn iyen; kepe thou hem in the myddil of thin herte.
22 For tho ben lijf to men fyndynge thoo, and heelthe `of al fleisch.
23 With al keping kepe thin herte, for lijf cometh forth of it.
24 Remoue thou a schrewid mouth fro thee; and backbitynge lippis be fer fro thee.
25 Thin iyen se riytful thingis; and thin iyeliddis go bifore thi steppis.
26 Dresse thou pathis to thi feet, and alle thi weies schulen be stablischid.
27 Bowe thou not to the riytside, nether to the leftside; turne awei thi foot fro yuel. For the Lord knowith the weies that ben at the riytside; but the weies ben weiward, that ben at the leftside. Forsothe he schal make thi goyngis riytful; and thi weies schulen be brouyt forth in pees.

CAP 5
1 Mi sone, perseyue thou my wisdom, and bowe doun thin eere to my prudence; that thou kepe thi thouytis,
2 and thi lippis kepe teching. Yyue thou not tent to the falsnesse of a womman;
3 for the lippis of an hoore ben an hony coomb droppinge, and hir throte is clerere than oile;
4 but the last thingis ben bittir as wormod, and hir tunge is scharp as a swerd keruynge on ech side.
5 Hir feet gon doun in to deeth; and hir steppis persen to hellis.
6 Tho goon not bi the path of lijf; hir steppis ben vncerteyn, and moun not be souyt out.
7 Now therfor, my sone, here thou me, and go not awei fro the wordis of my mouth.
8 Make fer thi weie fro hir, and neiye thou not to the doris of hir hous.
9 Yyue thou not thin onour to aliens, and thi yeeris to the cruel;
10 lest perauenture straungeris be fillid with thi strengthis, and lest thi trauels be in an alien hous;
11 and thou biweile in the laste daies, whanne thou hast wastid thi fleschis, and thi bodi; and thou seie,
12 Whi wlatide Y teching, and myn herte assentide not to blamyngis;
13 nether Y herde the voys of men techinge me, and Y bowide not doun myn eere to maistris?
14 Almest Y was in al yuel, in the myddis of the chirche, and of the synagoge.
15 Drinke thou watir of thi cisterne, and the floodis of thi pit.
16 Thi wellis be stremed forth; and departe thi watris in stretis.
17 Haue thou aloone `tho watris; and aliens be not thi parceneris.
18 Thi veyne be blessid; and be thou glad with the womman of thi yong wexynge age.
19 An hynde moost dereworthe; and an hert calf moost acceptable. Hir teetis fille thee in al tyme; and delite thou contynueli in the loue of hir.
20 Mi sone, whi art thou disseyued of an alien womman; and art fostrid in the bosum of an othere?
21 The Lord seeth the weie of a man; and biholdith alle hise steppis.
22 The wickidnessis of a wyckid man taken hym; and he is boundun with the roopis of hise synnes.
23 He schal die, for he hadde not lernyng; and he schal be disseyued in the mychilnesse of his fooli.

CAP 6
1 Mi sone, if thou hast bihiyt for thi freend; thou hast fastned thin hoond at a straunger.
2 Thou art boundun bi the wordis of thi mouth; and thou art takun with thin owne wordis.
3 Therfor, my sone, do thou that that Y seie, and delyuere thi silf; for thou hast fallun in to the hond of thi neiybore. Renne thou aboute, haste thou, reise thi freend;
4 yyue thou not sleep to thin iyen, nether thin iyeliddis nappe.
5 Be thou rauyschid as a doo fro the hond; and as a bridde fro aspiyngis of the foulere.
6 O! thou slowe man, go to the `amte, ether pissemyre; and biholde thou hise weies, and lerne thou wisdom.
7 Which whanne he hath no duyk, nethir comaundour, nether prince;
8 makith redi in somer mete to hym silf, and gaderith togidere in heruest that, that he schal ete.
9 Hou long schalt thou, slow man, slepe? whanne schalt thou rise fro thi sleep?
10 A litil thou schalt slepe, a litil thou schalt nappe; a litil thou schalt ioyne togidere thin hondis, that thou slepe.
11 And nedynesse, as a weigoere, schal come to thee; and pouert, as an armed man. Forsothe if thou art not slow, thi ripe corn schal come as a welle; and nedynesse schal fle fer fro thee.
12 A man apostata, a man vnprofitable, he goith with a weiward mouth;
13 he bekeneth with iyen, he trampith with the foot, he spekith with the fyngur,
14 bi schrewid herte he ymagyneth yuel, and in al tyme he sowith dissenciouns.
15 His perdicioun schal come to hym anoon, and he schal be brokun sodeynli; and he schal no more haue medecyn.
16 Sixe thingis ben, whyche the Lord hatith; and hise soule cursith the seuenthe thing.
17 Hiye iyen, a tunge liere, hondis schedinge out innocent blood,
18 an herte ymagynynge worste thouytis, feet swifte to renne in to yuel,
19 a man bringynge forth lesingis, a fals witnesse; and him that sowith discordis among britheren.
20 Mi sone, kepe the comaundementis of thi fadir; and forsake not the lawe of thi modir.
21 Bynde thou tho continueli in thin herte; and cumpasse `to thi throte.
22 Whanne thou goist, go tho with thee; whanne thou slepist, kepe tho thee; and thou wakynge speke with tho.
23 For the comaundement of God is a lanterne, and the lawe is liyt, and the blamyng of techyng is the weie of lijf;
24 `that the comaundementis kepe thee fro an yuel womman, and fro a flaterynge tunge of a straunge womman.
25 Thin herte coueite not the fairnesse of hir; nether be thou takun bi the signes of hir.
26 For the prijs of an hoore is vnnethe of o loof; but a womman takith the preciouse soule of a man.
27 Whether a man mai hide fier in his bosum, that hise clothis brenne not;
28 ethir go on colis, and hise feet be not brent?
29 So he that entrith to the wijf of his neiybore; schal not be cleene, whanne he hath touchid hir.
30 It is not greet synne, whanne a man stelith; for he stelith to fille an hungri soule.
31 And he takun schal yelde the seuenthe fold; and he schal yyue al the catel of his hous, and schal delyuere hym silf.
32 But he that is avouter; schal leese his soule, for the pouert of herte.
33 He gaderith filthe, and sclaundrith to hym silf; and his schenschip schal not be don awei.
34 For the feruent loue and strong veniaunce of the man schal not spare in the dai of veniaunce,
35 nether schal assente to the preieris of ony; nether schal take ful many yiftis for raunsum.

CAP 7
1 Mi sone, kepe thou my wordis; and kepe myn heestis to thee. Sone, onoure thou the Lord, and thou schalt be `myyti; but outakun hym drede thou not an alien.
2 Kepe thou myn heestis, and thou schalt lyue; and my lawe as the appil of thin iyen.
3 Bynde thou it in thi fyngris; write thou it in the tablis of thin herte.
4 Seie thou to wisdom, Thou art my sistir; and clepe thou prudence thi frendesse.
5 That it kepe thee fro a straunge womman; and fro an alien womman, that makith hir wordis swete.
6 For whi fro the wyndow of myn hous bi the latijs Y bihelde; and Y se litle children.
7 I biholde a yong man coward,
8 that passith bi the stretis, bisidis the corner; and he
9 goith niy the weie of hir hous in derk tyme, whanne the dai drawith to niyt, in the derknessis and myst of the nyyt.
10 And lo! a womman, maad redi with ournement of an hoore to disseyue soulis, meetith hym, and sche is a ianglere, and goynge about,
11 and vnpacient of reste, and mai not stonde in the hous with hir feet;
12 and now without forth, now in stretis, now bisidis corneris sche `aspieth.
13 And sche takith, and kissith the yong man; and flaterith with wowynge cheer, and seith, Y ouyte sacrifices for heelthe;
14 to dai Y haue yolde my vowis.
15 Therfor Y yede out in to thi meetyng, and Y desiride to se thee; and Y haue founde thee.
16 Y haue maad my bed with coordis, Y haue arayed with tapetis peyntid of Egipt;
17 Y haue bispreynt my bed with myrre, and aloes, and canel.
18 Come thou, be we fillid with tetis, and vse we collyngis that ben coueitid; til the dai bigynne to be cleer.
19 For myn hosebonde is not in his hows; he is goon a ful long weie.
20 He took with hym a bagge of money; he schal turne ayen in to his hous in the dai of ful moone.
21 Sche boonde hym with many wordis; and sche drow forth hym with flateryngis of lippis.
22 Anoon he as an oxe led to slayn sacrifice sueth hir, and as a ioli lomb and vnkunnynge; and the fool woot not, that he is drawun to bondys,
23 til an arowe perse his mawe. As if a brid hastith to the snare; and woot not, that it is don of the perel of his lijf.
24 Now therfor, my sone, here thou me; and perseyue the wordis of my mouth.
25 Lest thi soule be drawun awei in the weies of hir; nether be thou disseyued in the pathis of hir.
26 For sche castide doun many woundid men; and alle strongeste men weren slayn of hir.
27 The weies of helle is hir hous; and persen in to ynnere thingis of deeth.

CAP 8
1 Whether wisdom crieth not ofte; and prudence yyueth his vois?
2 In souereyneste and hiy coppis, aboue the weie, in the myddis of pathis,
3 and it stondith bisidis the yate of the citee, in thilke closyngis, and spekith, and seith, A!
4 ye men, Y crie ofte to you; and my vois is to the sones of men.
5 Litle children, vndirstonde ye wisdom; and ye vnwise men, `perseyue wisdom.
6 Here ye, for Y schal speke of grete thingis; and my lippis schulen be openyd, to preche riytful thingis.
7 My throte schal bithenke treuthe; and my lippis schulen curse a wickid man.
8 My wordis ben iust; no schrewid thing, nether weiward is in tho.
9 `My wordis ben riytful to hem that vndurstonden; and ben euene to hem that fynden kunnyng.
10 Take ye my chastisyng, and not money; chese ye teching more than tresour.
11 For wisdom is betere than alle richessis moost preciouse; and al desirable thing mai not be comparisound therto.
12 Y, wisdom, dwelle in counsel; and Y am among lernyd thouytis.
13 The drede of the Lord hatith yuel; Y curse boost, and pride, and a schrewid weie, and a double tungid mouth.
14 Counseil is myn, and equyte `is myn; prudence is myn, and strengthe `is myn.
15 Kyngis regnen bi me; and the makeris of lawis demen iust thingis bi me.
16 Princis comaunden bi me; and myyti men demen riytfulnesse bi me.
17 I loue hem that louen me; and thei that waken eerli to me, schulen fynde me.
18 With me ben rychessis, and glorie; souereyn richessis, and riytfulnesse.
19 My fruyt is betere than gold, and precyouse stoon; and my seedis ben betere than chosun siluer.
20 Y go in the weies of riytfulnesse, in the myddis of pathis of doom;
21 that Y make riche hem that louen me, and that Y fille her tresouris.
22 The Lord weldide me in the bigynnyng of hise weies; bifore that he made ony thing, at the bigynnyng.
23 Fro with out bigynnyng Y was ordeined; and fro elde tymes, bifor that the erthe was maad.
24 Depthis of watris weren not yit; and Y was conseyued thanne. The wellis of watris hadden not brokun out yit,
25 and hillis stoden not togidere yit bi sad heuynesse; bifor litil hillis Y was born.
26 Yit he hadde not maad erthe; and floodis, and the herris of the world.
27 Whanne he made redi heuenes, Y was present; whanne he cumpasside the depthis of watris bi certeyn lawe and cumpas.
28 Whanne he made stidfast the eir aboue; and weiede the wellis of watris.
29 Whanne he cumpasside to the see his marke; and settide lawe to watris, that tho schulden not passe her coostis. Whanne he peiside the foundementis of erthe;
30 Y was making alle thingis with him. And Y delitide bi alle daies, and pleiede bifore hym in al tyme,
31 and Y pleiede in the world; and my delices ben to be with the sones of men.
32 Now therfor, sones, here ye me; blessid ben thei that kepen my weies.
33 Here ye teching, and be ye wise men; and nile ye caste it awei.
34 Blessid is the man that herith me, and that wakith at my yatis al dai; and kepith at the postis of my dore.
35 He that fyndith me, schal fynde lijf; and schal drawe helthe of the Lord.
36 But he that synneth ayens me, schal hurte his soule; alle that haten me, louen deeth.

CAP 9
1 Wisdom bildide an hous to him silf; he hewide out seuene pileris,
2 he offride his slayn sacrifices, he medlide wijn, and settide forth his table.
3 He sente hise handmaides, that thei schulden clepe to the tour; and to the wallis of the citee.
4 If ony man is litil; come he to me. And wisdom spak to vnwise men,
5 Come ye, ete ye my breed; and drynke ye the wiyn, which Y haue medlid to you.
6 Forsake ye yong childhed, and lyue ye; and go ye bi the weyes of prudence.
7 He that techith a scornere, doith wrong to him silf; and he that vndirnymmeth a wickid man, gendrith a wem to him silf.
8 Nile thou vndirnyme a scornere; lest he hate thee. Vndirnyme thou a wise man; and he schal loue thee.
9 Yyue thou occasioun to a wise man; and wisdom schal be encreessid to hym. Teche thou a iust man; and he schal haste to take.
10 The bigynnyng of wisdom is the dreed of the Lord; and prudence is the kunnyng of seyntis.
11 For thi daies schulen be multiplied bi me; and yeeris of lijf schulen be encreessid to thee.
12 If thou art wijs; thou schalt be to thi silf, and to thi neiyboris. Forsothe if thou art a scornere; thou aloone schalt bere yuel.
13 A fonned womman, and ful of cry, and ful of vnleueful lustis, and that kan no thing outirli,
14 sittith in the doris of hir hous, on a seete, in an hiy place of the cite;
15 to clepe men passinge bi the weie, and men goynge in her iournei.
16 Who is a litil man `of wit; bowe he to me. And sche spak to a coward,
17 Watris of thefte ben swettere, and breed hid is swettere.
18 And wiste not that giauntis ben there; and the gestis `of hir ben in the depthis of helle. Sotheli he that schal be applied, ether fastned, to hir; schal go doun to hellis. For whi he that goith awei fro hir; schal be saued.

CAP 10
1 The parablis of Salomon. A wijs sone makith glad the fadir; but a fonned sone is the sorewe of his modir.
2 Tresouris of wickidnesse schulen not profite; but riytfulnesse schal delyuere fro deth.
3 The Lord schal not turmente the soule of a iust man with hungur; and he schal distrie the tresouns of vnpitouse men.
4 A slow hond hath wrouyt nedynesse; but the hond of stronge men makith redi richessis. Forsothe he that enforsith to gete `ony thing bi leesyngis, fedith the wyndis; sotheli the same man sueth briddis fleynge.
5 He that gaderith togidere in heruest, is a wijs sone; but he that slepith in sommer, is a sone of confusioun.
6 The blessing of God is ouer the heed of a iust man; but wickidnesse hilith the mouth of wickid men.
7 The mynde of a iust man schal be with preisingis; and the name of wickid men schal wexe rotun.
8 A wijs man schal resseyue comaundementis with herte; a fool is betun with lippis.
9 He that goith simpli, goith tristili; but he that makith schrewid hise weies, schal be opyn.
10 He that bekeneth with the iye, schal yyue sorewe; a fool schal be betun with lippis.
11 The veyne of lijf is the mouth of a iust man; but the mouth of wickid men hilith wickidnesse.
12 Hatrede reisith chidingis; and charite hilith alle synnes.
13 Wisdom is foundun in the lippis of a wise man; and a yerd in the bak of him that is nedi of herte.
14 Wise men hiden kunnyng; but the mouth of a fool is nexte to confusioun.
15 The catel of a riche man is the citee of his strengthe; the drede of pore men is the nedynesse of hem.
16 The werk of a iust man is to lijf; but the fruyt of a wickid man is to synne.
17 The weie of lijf is to him that kepith chastising; but he that forsakith blamyngis, errith.
18 False lippis hiden hatrede; he that bringith forth dispisinge is vnwijs.
19 Synne schal not faile in myche spekyng; but he that mesurith hise lippis, is moost prudent.
20 Chosun siluer is the tunge of a iust man; the herte of wickid men is for nouyt.
21 The lippis of a iust man techen ful manye men; but thei that ben vnlerned, schulen die in nedinesse of herte.
22 The blessing of the Lord makith riche men; and turment schal not be felowschipid to hem.
23 A fool worchith wickidnesse as bi leiyyng; but `wisdom is prudence to a man.
24 That that a wickid man dredith, schal come on hym; the desire of iust men schalbe youun to hem.
25 As a tempeste passynge, a wickid man schal not be; but a iust man schal be as an euerlastynge foundement.
26 As vynegre noieth the teeth, and smoke noieth the iyen; so a slow man noieth hem that senten hym in the weie.
27 The drede of the Lord encreesith daies; and the yeeris of wickid men schulen be maad schort.
28 Abiding of iust men is gladnesse; but the hope of wickid men schal perische.
29 The strengthe of a symple man is the weie of the Lord; and drede to hem that worchen yuel.
30 A iust man schal not be moued with outen ende; but wickid men schulen not dwelle on the erthe.
31 The mouth of a iust man schal bringe forth wisdom; the tunge of schrewis schal perische.
32 The lippis of a iust man biholden pleasaunt thingis; and the mouth of wickid men byholdith weiward thingis.

CAP 11
1 A gileful balaunce is abhominacioun anentis God; and an euene weiyte is his wille.
2 Where pride is, there also dispising schal be; but where meeknesse is, there also is wisdom.
3 The simplenesse of iust men schal dresse hem; and the disseyuyng of weiward men schal destrie hem.
4 Richessis schulen not profite in the dai of veniaunce; but riytfulnesse schal delyuere fro deth.
5 The riytfulnesse of a simple man schal dresse his weie; and a wickid man schal falle in his wickidnesse.
6 The riytfulnesse of riytful men schal delyuere hem; and wickid men schulen be takun in her aspiyngis.
7 Whanne a wickid man is deed, noon hope schal be ferther; and abidyng of bisy men schal perische.
8 A iust man is delyuered from angwisch; and a wickid man schal be youun for hym.
9 A feynere bi mouth disseyueth his freend; but iust men schulen be deliuered bi kunnyng.
10 A citee schal be enhaunsid in the goodis of iust men; and preysyng schal be in the perdicioun of wickid men.
11 A citee schal be enhaunsid bi blessing of iust men; and it schal be distried bi the mouth of wickid men.
12 He that dispisith his freend, is nedi in herte; but a prudent man schal be stille.
13 He that goith gilefuli, schewith priuetees; but he that is feithful, helith the priuetee of a freend.
14 Where a gouernour is not, the puple schal falle; but helthe `of the puple is, where ben many counsels.
15 He that makith feith for a straunger, schal be turmentid with yuel; but he that eschewith snaris, schal be sikur.
16 A graciouse womman schal fynde glorie; and stronge men schulen haue richessis.
17 A merciful man doith wel to his soule; but he that is cruel, castith awei, yhe, kynnesmen.
18 A wickid man makith vnstable werk; but feithful mede is to hym, that sowith riytfulnesse.
19 Merci schal make redi lijf; and the suyng of yuels `schal make redi deth.
20 A schrewid herte is abhomynable to the Lord; and his wille is in hem, that goen symply.
21 Thouy hond be in the hond, an yuel man schal not be innocent; but the seed of iust men schal be sauyd.
22 A goldun `sercle, ether ryng, in the `nose thrillis of a sowe, a womman fair and fool.
23 The desir of iust men is al good; abiding of wickid men is woodnesse.
24 Sum men departen her owne thingis, and ben maad richere; other men rauyschen thingis, that ben not hern, and ben euere in nedynesse.
25 A soule that blessith, schal be maad fat; and he that fillith, schal be fillid also.
26 He that hidith wheete `in tyme, schal be cursid among the puplis; but blessyng schal come on the heed of silleris.
27 Wel he risith eerli, that sekith good thingis; but he that is a serchere of yuels, schal be oppressid of tho.
28 He that tristith in hise richessis, schal falle; but iust men schulen buriowne as a greene leef.
29 He that disturblith his hows, schal haue wyndis in possessioun; and he that is a fool, schal serue a wijs man.
30 The fruyt of a riytful man is the tre of lijf; and he that takith soulis, is a wijs man.
31 If a iust man receyueth in erthe, how miche more an vnfeithful man, and synnere.

CAP 12
1 He that loueth chastisyng, loueth kunnyng; but he that hatith blamyngis, is vnwijs.
2 He that is good, schal drawe to hym silf grace of the Lord; but he that tristith in hise thouytis, doith wickidli.
3 A man schal not be maad strong by wyckidnesse; and the root of iust men schal not be moued.
4 A diligent womman is a coroun to hir hosebond; and rot is in the boonys of that womman, that doith thingis worthi of confusioun.
5 The thouytis of iust men ben domes; and the counselis of wickid men ben gileful.
6 The wordis of wickid men setten tresoun to blood; the mouth of iust men schal delyuere hem.
7 Turne thou wickid men, and thei schulen not be; but the housis of iust men schulen dwelle perfitli.
8 A man schal be knowun bi his teching; but he that is veyn and hertles, schal be open to dispising.
9 Betere is a pore man, and sufficient to him silf, than a gloriouse man, and nedi of breed.
10 A iust man knowith the soulis of hise werk beestis; but the entrailis of wickid men ben cruel.
11 He that worchith his lond, schal be fillid with looues; but he that sueth idilnesse, is moost fool. He that is swete, lyueth in temperaunces; and in hise monestyngis he forsakith dispisyngis.
12 The desir of a wickid man is the memorial of worste thingis; but the roote of iust men schal encreesse.
13 For the synnes of lippis `falling doun neiyeth to an yuel man; but a iust man schal scape fro angwisch.
14 Of the fruyt of his mouth ech man schal be fillid with goodis; and bi the werkis of hise hondis it schal be yoldun to him.
15 The weie of a fool is riytful in hise iyen; but he that is wijs, herith counsels.
16 A fool schewith anoon his ire; but he that dissymelith wrongis, is wijs.
17 He that spekith that, that he knowith, is a iuge of riytfulnesse; but he that lieth, is a gileful witnesse.
18 A man is that bihetith, and he is prickid as with the swerd of conscience; but the tunge of wise men is helthe.
19 The lippe of treuthe schal be stidfast with outen ende; but he that is a sudeyn witnesse, makith redi the tunge of leesyng.
20 Gile is in the herte of hem that thenken yuels; but ioye sueth hem, that maken counsels of pees.
21 What euere bifallith to a iust man, it schal not make hym sori; but wickid men schulen be fillid with yuel.
22 False lippis is abhominacioun to the Lord; but thei that don feithfuli, plesen him.
23 A fel man hilith kunnyng; and the herte of vnwise men stirith foli.
24 The hond of stronge men schal haue lordschip; but the hond that is slow, schal serue to tributis.
25 Morenynge in the herte of a iust man schal make hym meke; and he schal be maad glad bi a good word.
26 He that dispisith harm for a frend, is a iust man; but the weie of wickid men schal disseyue hem.
27 A gileful man schal not fynde wynnyng; and the substaunce of man schal be the prijs of gold.
28 Lijf is in the path of riytfulnesse; but the wrong weie leedith to deeth.

CAP 13
1 A wijs sone is the teching of the fadir; but he that is a scornere, herith not, whanne he is repreuyd.
2 A man schal be fillid with goodis of the fruit of his mouth; but the soule of vnpitouse men is wickid.
3 He that kepith his mouth, kepith his soule; but he that is vnwar to speke, schal feel yuels.
4 A slow man wole, and wole not; but the soule of hem that worchen schal be maad fat.
5 A iust man schal wlate a fals word; but a wickid man schendith, and schal be schent.
6 Riytfulnesse kepith the weie of an innocent man; but wickidnesse disseyueth a synnere.
7 A man is as riche, whanne he hath no thing; and a man is as pore, whanne he is in many richessis.
8 Redempcioun of the soule of man is hise richessis; but he that is pore, suffrith not blamyng.
9 The liyt of iust men makith glad; but the lanterne of wickid men schal be quenchid.
10 Stryues ben euere a mong proude men; but thei that don alle thingis with counsel, ben gouerned bi wisdom.
11 Hastid catel schal be maad lesse; but that that is gaderid litil and litil with hond, schal be multiplied.
12 Hope which is dilaied, turmentith the soule; a tre of lijf is desir comyng.
13 He that bacbitith ony thing, byndith hym silf in to tyme to comynge; but he that dredith the comaundement, schal lyue in pees.
14 The lawe of a wise man is a welle of lijf; that he bowe awei fro the falling of deth.
15 Good teching schal yyue grace; a swolowe is in the weie of dispiseris.
16 A fel man doith alle thingis with counsel; but he that is a fool, schal opene foli.
17 The messanger of a wickid man schal falle in to yuel; a feithful messanger is helthe.
18 Nedynesse and schenschip is to him that forsakith techyng; but he that assentith to a blamere, schal be glorified.
19 Desir, if it is fillid, delitith the soule; foolis wlaten hem that fleen yuels.
20 He that goith with wijs men, schal be wijs; the freend of foolis schal be maad lijk hem.
21 Yuel pursueth synneris; and goodis schulen be yoldun to iust men.
22 A good man schal leeue aftir him eiris, sones, and the sones of sones; and the catel of a synnere is kept to a iust man.
23 Many meetis ben in the new tilid feeldis of fadris; and ben gaderid to othere men with out doom.
24 He that sparith the yerde, hatith his sone; but he that loueth him, techith bisili.
25 A iust man etith, and fillith his soule; but the wombe of wickid men is vnable to be fillid.

CAP 14
1 A wijs womman bildith hir hous; and an unwijs womman schal distrie with hondis an hous bildid.
2 A man goynge in riytful weie, and dredinge God, is dispisid of hym, that goith in a weie of yuel fame.
3 The yerde of pride is in the mouth of a fool; the lippis of wijs men kepen hem.
4 Where oxis ben not, the cratche is void; but where ful many cornes apperen, there the strengthe of oxe is opyn.
5 A feithful witnesse schal not lie; a gileful witnesse bringith forth a leesing.
6 A scornere sekith wisdom, and he fyndith not; the teching of prudent men is esy.
7 Go thou ayens a man a fool; and he schal not knowe the lippis of prudence.
8 The wisdom of a fel man is to vndirstonde his weie; and the vnwarnesse of foolis errith.
9 A fool scorneth synne; grace schal dwelle among iust men.
10 The herte that knowith the bittirnesse of his soule; a straunger schal not be meddlid in the ioie therof.
11 The hous of wickid men schal be don awei; the tabernaclis of iust men schulen buriowne.
12 Sotheli a weie is, that semeth iust to a man; but the laste thingis therof leden forth to deth.
13 Leiyyng schal be medlid with sorewe; and morenyng ocupieth the laste thingis of ioye.
14 A fool schal be fillid with hise weies; and a good man schal be aboue hym.
15 An innocent man bileueth to eche word; a felle man biholdith hise goyngis.
16 A wijs man dredith, and bowith awei fro yuel; a fool skippith ouer, and tristith.
17 A man vnpacient schal worche foli; and a gileful man is odiouse.
18 Litle men of wit schulen holde foli; and felle men schulen abide kunnyng.
19 Yuel men schulen ligge bifor goode men; and vnpitouse men bifor the yatis of iust men.
20 A pore man schal be hateful, yhe, to his neiybore; but many men ben frendis of riche men.
21 He that dispisith his neiybore, doith synne; but he that doith merci to a pore man, schal be blessid. He that bileueth in the Lord, loueth merci;
22 thei erren that worchen yuel. Merci and treuthe maken redi goodis;
23 abundaunce `schal be in ech good werk. Sotheli where ful many wordis ben, there nedynesse is ofte.
24 The coroun of wise men is the richessis of hem; the fooli of foolis is vnwarnesse.
25 A feithful witnesse delyuereth soulis; and a fals man bringith forth leesyngis.
26 In the drede of the Lord is triste of strengthe; and hope schal be to the sones of it.
27 The drede of the Lord is a welle of lijf; that it bowe awei fro the fallyng of deth.
28 The dignite of the king is in the multitude of puple; and the schenschipe of a prince is in the fewnesse of puple.
29 He that is pacient, is gouerned bi myche wisdom; but he that is vnpacient, enhaunsith his foli.
30 Helthe of herte is the lijf of fleischis; enuye is rot of boonys.
31 He that falsli chalengith a nedi man, dispisith his maker; but he that hath merci on a pore man, onourith that makere.
32 A wickid man is put out for his malice; but a iust man hopith in his deth.
33 Wisdom restith in the herte of a wijs man; and he schal teche alle vnlerned men.
34 Riytfulnesse reisith a folc; synne makith puplis wretchis.
35 A mynystre vndurstondynge is acceptable to a kyng; a mynystre vnprofitable schal suffre the wrathfulnesse of him.

CAP 15
1 A soft answere brekith ire; an hard word reisith woodnesse.
2 The tunge of wise men ourneth kunnyng; the mouth of foolis buylith out foli.
3 In ech place the iyen of the Lord biholden good men, and yuel men.
4 A plesaunt tunge is the tre of lijf; but the tunge which is vnmesurable, schal defoule the spirit.
5 A fool scorneth the techyng of his fadir; but he that kepith blamyngis, schal be maad wisere. Moost vertu schal be in plenteuouse riytfulnesse; but the thouytis of wickid men schulen be drawun vp bi the roote.
6 The hous of a iust man is moost strengthe; and disturbling is in the fruitis of a wickid man.
7 The lippis of wise men schulen sowe abrood kunnyng; the herte of foolis schal be vnlijc.
8 The sacrifices of wickyd men ben abhomynable to the Lord; avowis of iust men ben plesaunt.
9 The lijf of the vnpitouse man is abhomynacioun to the Lord; he that sueth riytfulnesse, schal be loued of the Lord.
10 Yuel teching is of men forsakinge the weie of lijf; he that hatith blamyngis, schal die.
11 Helle and perdicioun ben open bifor the Lord; hou myche more the hertis of sones of men.
12 A man ful of pestilence loueth not hym that repreueth him; and he goith not to wyse men.
13 A ioiful herte makith glad the face; the spirit is cast doun in the morenyng of soule.
14 The herte of a wijs man sekith techyng; and the mouth of foolis is fed with vnkunnyng.
15 Alle the daies of a pore man ben yuele; a sikir soule is a contynuel feeste.
16 Betere is a litil with the drede of the Lord, than many tresouris and vnfillable.
17 It is betere to be clepid to wortis with charite, than with hatrede to a calf maad fat.
18 A wrathful man reisith chidyngis; he that is pacient, swagith chidyngis reisid.
19 The weie of slow men is an hegge of thornes; the weie of iust men is with out hirtyng.
20 A wise sone makith glad the fadir; and a fonned man dispisith his modir.
21 Foli is ioye to a fool; and a prudent man schal dresse hise steppis.
22 Thouytis ben distried, where no counsel is; but where many counseleris ben, tho ben confermyd.
23 A man is glad in the sentence of his mouth; and a couenable word is best.
24 The path of lijf is on a lernyd man; that he bowe awei fro the laste helle.
25 The Lord schal distrie the hows of proude men; and he schal make stidefast the coostis of a widewe.
26 Iuele thouytis is abhomynacioun of the Lord; and a cleene word moost fair schal be maad stidfast of hym.
27 He that sueth aueryce, disturblith his hous; but he that hatith yiftis schal lyue. Synnes ben purgid bi merci and feith; ech man bowith awei fro yuel bi the drede of the Lord.
28 The soule of a iust man bithenkith obedience; the mouth of wickid men is ful of yuelis.
29 The Lord is fer fro wickid men; and he schal here the preyers of iust men.
30 The liyt of iyen makith glad the soule; good fame makith fat the boonys.
31 The eere that herith the blamyngis of lijf, schal dwelle in the myddis of wise men.
32 He that castith awei chastisyng, dispisith his soule; but he that assentith to blamyngis, is pesible holdere of the herte.
33 The drede of the Lord is teching of wisdom; and mekenesse goith bifore glorie.

CAP 16
1 It perteyneth to man to make redi the soule; and it perteyneth to the Lord to gouerne the tunge.
2 Alle the weies of men ben opyn to the iyen of God; the Lord is a weiere of spiritis.
3 Schewe thi werkys to the Lord; and thi thouytis schulen be dressid.
4 The Lord wrouyte alle thingis for hym silf; and he made redi a wickid man to the yuel dai.
5 Abhomynacioun of the Lord is ech proude man; yhe, thouy the hond is to the hond, he schal not be innocent. The bigynnyng of good weie is to do riytwisnesse; forsothe it is more acceptable at God, than to offre sacrifices.
6 Wickidnesse is ayen bouyt bi merci and treuthe; and me bowith awei fro yuel bi the drede of the Lord.
7 Whanne the weyes of man plesen the Lord, he schal conuerte, yhe, hise enemyes to pees.
8 Betere is a litil with riytfulnesse, than many fruytis with wickidnesse.
9 The herte of a man schal dispose his weie; but it perteyneth to the Lord to dresse hise steppis.
10 Dyuynyng is in the lippis of a king; his mouth schal not erre in doom.
11 The domes of the Lord ben weiyte and a balaunce; and hise werkis ben alle the stoonys of the world.
12 Thei that don wickidli ben abhomynable to the king; for the trone of the rewme is maad stidfast bi riytfulnesse.
13 The wille of kyngis is iust lippis; he that spekith riytful thingis, schal be dressid.
14 Indignacioun of the kyng is messangeris of deth; and a wijs man schal plese him.
15 Lijf is in the gladnesse of the `cheer of the king; and his merci is as a reyn comynge late.
16 Welde thou wisdom, for it is betere than gold; and gete thou prudence, for it is precyousere than siluer.
17 The path of iust men bowith awei yuelis; the kepere of his soule kepith his weie.
18 Pride goith bifore sorewe; and the spirit schal be enhaunsid byfor fallyng.
19 It is betere to be maad meke with mylde men, than to departe spuylis with proude men.
20 A lerned man in word schal fynde goodis; and he that hopith in the Lord is blessid.
21 He that is wijs in herte, schal be clepid prudent; and he that is swete in speche, schal fynde grettere thingis.
22 The welle of lijf is the lernyng of him that weldith; the techyng of foolis is foli.
23 The herte of a wijs man schal teche his mouth; and schal encreesse grace to hise lippis.
24 Wordis wel set togidere is a coomb of hony; helthe of boonys is the swetnesse of soule.
25 A weye is that semeth riytful to a man; and the laste thingis therof leden to deth.
26 The soule of a man trauelinge trauelith to hym silf; for his mouth compellide hym.
27 An vnwijs man diggith yuel; and fier brenneth in hise lippis.
28 A weiward man reisith stryues; and a man ful of wordis departith princis.
29 A wickid man flaterith his frend; and ledith hym bi a weie not good.
30 He that thenkith schrewid thingis with iyen astonyed, bitith hise lippis, and parformeth yuel.
31 A coroun of dignyte is eelde, that schal be foundun in the weies of riytfulnesse.
32 A pacient man is betere than a stronge man; and he that `is lord of his soule, is betere than an ouercomere of citees.
33 Lottis ben sent into the bosum; but tho ben temperid of the Lord.

CAP 17
1 Betere is a drie mussel with ioye, than an hous ful of sacrifices with chidyng.
2 A wijs seruaunt schal be lord of fonned sones; and he schal departe eritage among britheren.
3 As siluer is preued bi fier, and gold is preued bi a chymnei, so the Lord preueth hertis.
4 An yuel man obeieth to a wickid tunge; and a fals man obeieth to false lippis.
5 He that dispisith a pore man, repreueth his maker; and he that is glad in the fallyng of another man, schal not be vnpunyschid.
6 The coroun of elde men is the sones of sones; and the glorie of sones is the fadris of hem.
7 Wordis wel set togidere bisemen not a fool; and a liynge lippe bicometh not a prince.
8 A preciouse stoon moost acceptable is the abiding of hym that sekith; whidur euere he turneth hym silf, he vndurstondith prudentli.
9 He that helith trespas, sekith frenschipis; he that rehersith bi an hiy word, departith hem, that ben knyt togidere in pees.
10 A blamyng profitith more at a prudent man, than an hundryd woundis at a fool.
11 Euere an yuel man sekith stryues; forsothe a cruel aungel schal be sent ayens hym.
12 It spedith more to meete a femal bere, whanne the whelpis ben rauyschid, than a fool tristynge to hym silf in his foli.
13 Yuel schal not go a wei fro the hous of hym, that yeldith yuels for goodis.
14 He that leeueth watir, is heed of stryues; and bifor that he suffrith wrong, he forsakith dom.
15 Bothe he that iustifieth a wickid man, and he that condempneth a iust man, euer ethir is abhomynable at God.
16 What profitith it to a fool to haue richessis, sithen he mai not bie wisdom? He that makith his hous hiy, sekith falling; and he that eschewith to lerne, schal falle in to yuels.
17 He that is a frend, loueth in al tyme; and a brother is preuyd in angwischis.
18 A fonned man schal make ioie with hondis, whanne he hath bihiyt for his frend.
19 He that bithenkith discordis, loueth chidingis; and he that enhaunsith his mouth, sekith fallyng.
20 He that is of weiward herte, schal not fynde good; and he that turneth the tunge, schal falle in to yuel.
21 A fool is borun in his schenschipe; but nether the fadir schal be glad in a fool.
22 A ioiful soule makith likinge age; a sorewful spirit makith drie boonys.
23 A wickid man takith yiftis fro the bosum, to mys turne the pathis of doom.
24 Wisdom schyneth in the face of a prudent man; the iyen of foolis ben in the endis of erthe.
25 A fonned sone is the ire of the fadir, and the sorewe of the modir that gendride hym.
26 It is not good to brynge in harm to a iust man; nether to smyte the prince that demeth riytfuli.
27 He that mesurith his wordis, is wijs and prudent; and a lerud man is of preciouse spirit.
28 Also a foole, if he is stille, schal be gessid a wijs man; and, if he pressith togidre hise lippis, he `schal be gessid an vndurstondynge man.

CAP 18
1 He that wole go a wei fro a frend, sekith occasiouns; in al tyme he schal be dispisable.
2 A fool resseyueth not the wordis of prudence; `no but thou seie tho thingis, that ben turned in his herte.
3 A wickid man, whanne he cometh in to depthe of synnes, dispisith; but sclaundre and schenschipe sueth hym.
4 Deep watir is the wordis of the mouth of a man; and a stronde fletinge ouer is the welle of wisdom.
5 It is not good to take the persoone of a wickid man in doom, that thou bowe awei fro the treuthe of dom.
6 The lippis of a fool medlen hem silf with chidyngis; and his mouth excitith stryues.
7 The mouth of a fool is defoulyng of hym; and hise lippis ben the fallynge of his soule.
8 The wordis of a double tungid man ben as symple; and tho comen `til to the ynnere thingis of the wombe. Drede castith doun a slowe man; forsothe the soulis of men turned in to wymmens condicioun schulen haue hungur.
9 He that is neisch, and vnstidfast in his werk, is the brother of a man distriynge hise werkis.
10 A strongeste tour is the name of the Lord; a iust man renneth to hym, and schal be enhaunsid.
11 The catel of a riche man is the citee of his strengthe; and as a stronge wal cumpassinge hym.
12 The herte of man is enhaunsid, bifor that it be brokun; and it is maad meke, bifore that it be glorified.
13 He that answerith bifore that he herith, shewith hym silf to be a fool; and worthi of schenschipe.
14 The spirit of a man susteyneth his feblenesse; but who may susteyne a spirit liyt to be wrooth?
15 The herte of a prudent man schal holde stidfastli kunnyng; and the eere of wise men sekith techyng.
16 The yift of a man alargith his weie; and makith space to hym bifore princes.
17 A iust man is the first accusere of hym silf; his frend cometh, and schal serche hym.
18 Lot ceessith ayenseiyngis; and demeth also among miyti men.
19 A brother that is helpid of a brothir, is as a stidfast citee; and domes ben as the barris of citees.
20 A mannus wombe schal be fillid of the fruit of his mouth; and the seedis of hise lippis schulen fille hym.
21 Deth and lijf ben in the werkis of tunge; thei that louen it, schulen ete the fruytis therof.
22 He that fyndith a good womman, fyndith a good thing; and of the Lord he schal drawe vp myrthe. He that puttith a wey a good womman, puttith awei a good thing; but he that holdith auowtresse, is a fool and vnwijs.
23 A pore man schal speke with bisechingis; and a riche man schal speke sterneli.
24 A man freendli to felouschipe schal more be a frend, than a brothir.

CAP 19
1 Betere is a pore man, that goith in his simplenesse, than a riche man bitynge hise lippis, and vnwijs.
2 Where is not kunnyng of the soule, is not good; and he that is hasti, in feet hirtith.
3 The foli of a man disseyueth hise steppis; and he brenneth in his soule ayens God.
4 Richessis encreessen ful many freendis; forsothe also thei ben departid fro a pore man, whiche he hadde.
5 A fals witnesse schal not be vnpunyschid; and he that spekith leesingis, schal not ascape.
6 Many men onouren the persoone of a myyti man; and ben frendis of hym that deelith yiftis.
7 The britheren of a pore man haten hym; ferthermore and the freendis yeden awei fer fro hym. He that sueth wordis oonli, schal haue no thing;
8 but he that holdith stabli the mynde, loueth his soule, and the kepere of prudence schal fynde goodis.
9 A fals witnesse schal not be vnpunyschid; and he that spekith leesyngis, schal perische.
10 Delices bicomen not a fool; nether `it bicometh a seruaunt to be lord of princes.
11 The teching of a man is knowun bi pacience; and his glorie is to passe ouere wickid thingis.
12 As the gnasting of a lioun, so and the ire of the king; and as deewe on eerbe, so and the gladnesse of the kyng.
13 The sorewe of the fadir is a fonned sone; and roofes droppynge contynueli is a womman ful of chiding.
14 Housis and richessis ben youun of fadir and modir; but a prudent wijf is youun propirli of the Lord.
15 Slouth bringith in sleep; and a negligent soule schal haue hungur.
16 He that kepith the comaundement of God, kepith his soule; but he that chargith not his weie, schal be slayn.
17 He that hath mercy on a pore man, leeneth to the Lord; and he schal yelde his while to hym.
18 Teche thi sone, and dispeire thou not; but sette thou not thi soule to the sleyng of hym.
19 Forsothe he that is vnpacient, schal suffre harm; and whanne he hath rauyschid, he schal leie to anothir thing.
20 Here thou counsel, and take thou doctryn; that thou be wijs in thi laste thingis.
21 Many thouytis ben in the herte of a man; but the wille of the Lord schal dwelle.
22 A nedi man is merciful; and betere is a pore iust man, than a man liere.
23 The drede of the Lord ledith to lijf `of blis; and he `that dredith God schal dwelle in plentee, with outen visityng `of the worste.
24 A slow man hidith his hond vndur the armpit; and putteth it not to his mouth.
25 Whanne a man ful of pestilence is betun, a fool schal be wisere. If thou blamist a wijs man, he schal vndurstonde techyng.
26 He that turmentith the fadir, and fleeth fro the modir, schal be ful of yuel fame, and schal be cursid.
27 Sone, ceesse thou not to here techyng; and knowe thou the wordis of kunnyng.
28 A wickid witnesse scorneth doom; and the mouth of vnpitouse men deuourith wickidnesse.
29 Domes ben maad redi to scorneris; and hameris smytynge ben maad redi to the bodies of foolis.

CAP 20
1 Wiyn is a letcherouse thing  and drunkenesse is ful of noise; who euere delitith in these, schal not be wijs.
2 As the roryng of a lioun, so and the drede of the kyng; he that territh hym to ire, synneth ayens his owne lijf.
3 It is onour to a man that departith hym silf fro stryuyngis; but fonned men ben medlid with dispisyngis.
4 A slow man nolde ere for coold; therfor he schal begge in somer, and me schal not yyue to hym.
5 As deep watir, so counsel is in the herte of a man; but a wijs man schal drawe it out.
6 Many men ben clepid merciful; but who schal fynde a feithful man?
7 Forsothe a iust man that goith in his simplenesse, schal leeue blessid sones aftir hym.
8 A king that sittith in the seete of doom, distrieth al yuel bi his lokyng.
9 Who may seie, Myn herte is clene; Y am clene of synne?
10 A weiyte and a weiyte, a mesure and a mesure, euer eithir is abhomynable at God.
11 A child is vndurstondun bi hise studies, yf his werkis ben riytful and cleene.
12 An eere heringe, and an iye seynge, God made euere eithir.
13 Nyle thou loue sleep, lest nedynesse oppresse thee; opene thin iyen, and be thou fillid with looues.
14 Ech biere seith, It is yuel, it is yuel; and whanne he hath go awey, thanne he schal haue glorie.
15 Gold, and the multitude of iemmes, and a preciouse vessel, ben the lippis of kunnyng.
16 Take thou awei the cloth of hym, that was borewe of an othere man; and for straungeris take thou awei a wed fro hym.
17 The breed of a leesing is sweet to a man; and aftirward his mouth schal be fillid with rikenyng.
18 Thouytis ben maad strong bi counselis; and bateils schulen be tretid bi gouernals.
19 Be thou not medlid with him that schewith pryuetees, and goith gylefulli, and alargith hise lippis.
20 The liyt of hym that cursith his fadir and modir, schal be quenchid in the myddis of derknessis.
21 Eritage to which me haastith in the bigynnyng, schal wante blessing in the laste tyme.
22 Seie thou not, Y schal yelde yuel for yuel; abide thou the Lord, and he schal delyuere thee.
23 Abhomynacioun at God is weiyte and weiyte; a gileful balaunce is not good.
24 The steppis of man ben dressid of the Lord; who forsothe of men mai vndurstonde his weie?
25 Falling of man is to make auow to seyntis, and aftirward to withdrawe the vowis.
26 A wijs kyng scaterith wickid men; and bowith a bouwe of victorie ouer hem.
27 The lanterne of the Lord is the spirit of man, that sekith out alle the priuetees of the wombe.
28 Merci and treuthe kepen a kyng; and his trone is maad strong bi mekenesse.
29 The ful out ioiyng of yonge men is the strengthe of hem; and the dignyte of elde men is hoornesse.
30 The wannesse of wounde schal wipe aweie yuels, and woundis in the priuyere thingis of the wombe.

CAP 21
1 As departyngis of watris, so the herte of the kyng is in the power of the Lord; whidur euer he wole, he schal bowe it.
2 Ech weye of a man semeth riytful to hym silf; but the Lord peisith the hertis.
3 To do merci and doom  plesith more the Lord, than sacrifices doen.
4 Enhaunsyng of iyen is alargyng of the herte; the lanterne of wickid men is synne.
5 The thouytis of a stronge man ben euere in abundaunce; but ech slow man is euere in nedynesse.
6 He that gaderith tresours bi the tunge of a leesing, is veyne, and with outen herte; and he schal be hurtlid to the snaris of deth.
7 The raueyns of vnpitouse men schulen drawe hem doun; for thei nolden do doom.
8 The weiward weie of a man is alien fro God; but the werk of hym that is cleene, is riytful.
9 It is betere to sitte in the corner of an hous with oute roof, than with a womman ful of chydyng, and in a comyn hous.
10 The soule of an vnpitouse man desirith yuel; he schal not haue merci on his neiybore.
11 Whanne a man ful of pestilence is punyschid, a litil man of wit schal be the wisere; and if he sueth a wijs man, he schal take kunnyng.
12 A iust man of the hous of a wickid man thenkith, to withdrawe wickid men fro yuel.
13 He that stoppith his eere at the cry of a pore man, schal crye also, and schal not be herd.
14 A yift hid quenchith chidyngis; and a yift in bosum quenchith the moost indignacioun.
15 It is ioye to a iust man to make doom; and it is drede to hem that worchen wickidnesse.
16 A man that errith fro the weie of doctryn, schal dwelle in the cumpany of giauntis.
17 He that loueth metis, schal be in nedynesse; he that loueth wiyn and fatte thingis, schal not be maad riche.
18 An vnpitouse man schal be youun for a iust man; and a wickid man schal be youun for a riytful man.
19 It is betere to dwelle in a desert lond, than with a womman ful of chidyng, and wrathful.
20 Desirable tresoure and oile is in the dwelling places of a iust man; and an vnprudent man schal distrie it.
21 He that sueth riytfulnesse and mercy, schal fynde lijf and glorie.
22 A wijs man stiede `in to the citee of stronge men, and distriede the strengthe of trist therof.
23 He that kepith his mouth and his tunge, kepith his soule from angwischis.
24 A proude man and boosteere is clepid a fool, that worchith pride in ire.
25 Desiris sleen a slow man; for hise hondis nolden worche ony thing.
26 Al dai he coueitith and desirith; but he that is a iust man, schal yyue, and schal not ceesse.
27 The offringis of wickid men, that ben offrid of greet trespas, ben abhomynable.
28 A fals witnesse schal perische; a man obedient schal speke victorie.
29 A wickid man makith sad his cheer vnschamefastli; but he that is riytful, amendith his weie.
30 No wisdom is, no prudence is, no counsel is ayens the Lord.
31 An hors is maad redi to the dai of batel; but the Lord schal yyue helthe.

CAP 22
1 Betere is a good name, than many richessis; for good grace is aboue siluer and gold.
2 A riche man and a pore man metten hem silf; the Lord is worchere of euer eithir.
3 A felle man seeth yuel, and hidith him silf; and an innocent man passid, and he was turmentid bi harm.
4 The ende of temperaunce is the drede of the Lord; richessis, and glorye, and lijf.
5 Armuris and swerdis ben in the weie of a weiward man; but the kepere of his soule goith awey fer fro tho.
6 It is a prouerbe, A yong wexynge man bisidis his weie, and whanne he hath wexe elde, he schal not go awei fro it.
7 A riche man comaundith to pore men; and he that takith borewyng, is the seruaunt of the leenere.
8 He that sowith wickidnes, schal repe yuels; and the yerde of his yre schal be endid.
9 He that is redi to merci, schal be blessid; for of his looues he yaf to a pore man. He that yyueth yiftis, schal gete victorie and onour; forsothe he takith awei the soule of the takeris.
10 Caste thou out a scornere, and strijf schal go out with hym; and causis and dispisyngis schulen ceesse.
11 He that loueth the clennesse of herte, schal haue the kyng a freend, for the grace of hise lippis.
12 The iyen of the Lord kepen kunnyng; and the wordis of a wickid man ben disseyued.
13 A slow man schal seie, A lioun is withoutforth; Y schal be slayn in the myddis of the stretis.
14 The mouth of an alien womman is a deep diche; he to whom the Lord is wrooth, schal falle in to it.
15 Foli is boundun togidere in the herte of a child; and a yerde of chastisyng schal dryue it awey.
16 He that falsli chalengith a pore man, to encreesse hise owne richessis, schal yyue to a richere man, and schal be nedi.
17 My sone, bowe doun thin eere, and here thou the wordis of wise men; but sette thou the herte to my techyng.
18 That schal be fair to thee, whanne thou hast kept it in thin herte, and it schal flowe ayen in thi lippis.
19 That thi trist be in the Lord; wherfor and Y haue schewid it to thee to dai.
20 Lo! Y haue discryued it in thre maneres, in thouytis and kunnyng,
21 that Y schulde schewe to thee the sadnesse and spechis of trewthe; to answere of these thingis to hem, that senten thee.
22 Do thou not violence to a pore man, for he is pore; nethir defoule thou a nedi man in the yate.
23 For the Lord schal deme his cause, and he schal turmente hem, that turmentiden his soule.
24 Nyle thou be freend to a wrathful man, nether go thou with a wood man;
25 lest perauenture thou lerne hise weies, and take sclaundir to thi soule.
26 Nyle thou be with hem that oblischen her hondis, and that proferen hem silf borewis for dettis; for if he hath not wherof he schal restore,
27 what of cause is, that thou take awei hilyng fro thi bed?
28 Go thou not ouer the elde markis, whiche thi faders han set.
29 Thou hast seyn a man smert in his werk; he schal stonde bifore kyngis, and he schal not be bifor vnnoble men.

CAP 23
1 Whanne thou sittist, to ete with the prince, perseyue thou diligentli what thingis ben set bifore thi face,
2 and sette thou a withholding in thi throte. If netheles thou hast power on thi soule,
3 desire thou not of his metis, in whom is the breed of `a leesing.
4 Nyle thou trauele to be maad riche, but sette thou mesure to thi prudence.
5 Reise not thin iyen to richessis, whiche thou maist not haue; for tho schulen make to hem silf pennes, as of an egle, and tho schulen flee in to heuene.
6 Ete thou not with an enuyouse man, and desire thou not hise metis;
7 for at the licnesse of a fals dyuynour and of a coniectere, he gessith that, that he knowith not. He schal seie to thee, Ete thou and drinke; and his soule is not with thee.
8 Thou schalt brake out the metis, whiche thou hast ete; and thou schalt leese thi faire wordis.
9 Speke thou not in the eeris of vnwise men; for thei schulen dispise the teching of thi speche.
10 Touche thou not the termes of litle children; and entre thou not in to the feeld of fadirles and modirles children.
11 For the neiybore of hem is strong, and he schal deme her cause ayens thee.
12 Thin herte entre to techyng, and thin eeris `be redi to the wordis of kunnyng.
13 Nile thou withdrawe chastisyng fro a child; for thouy thou smyte hym with a yerde, he schal not die.
14 Thou schalt smyte hym with a yerde, and thou schalt delyuere his soule fro helle.
15 Mi sone, if thi soule is wijs, myn herte schal haue ioye with thee;
16 and my reynes schulen make ful out ioye, whanne thi lippis speken riytful thing.
17 Thin herte sue not synneris; but be thou in the drede of the Lord al dai.
18 For thou schalt haue hope at the laste, and thin abidyng schal not be don awei.
19 Mi sone, here thou, and be thou wijs, and dresse thi soule in the weie.
20 Nyle thou be in the feestis of drinkeris, nether in the ofte etyngis of hem, that bryngen togidere fleischis to ete.
21 For men yyuynge tent to drinkis, and yyuyng mussels togidere, schulen be waastid, and napping schal be clothid with clothis.
22 Here thi fadir, that gendride thee; and dispise not thi modir, whanne sche is eld.
23 Bie thou treuthe, and nyle thou sille wisdom, and doctryn, and vndurstonding.
24 The fadir of a iust man ioieth ful out with ioie; he that gendride a wijs man, schal be glad in hym.
25 Thi fadir and thi modir haue ioye, and he that gendride thee, make ful out ioye.
26 My sone, yyue thin herte to me, and thin iyen kepe my weyes.
27 For an hoore is a deep diche, and an alien womman is a streit pit.
28 Sche settith aspie in the weie, as a theef; and sche schal sle hem, whiche sche schal se vnwar.
29 To whom is wo? to whos fadir is wo? to whom ben chidingis? to whom ben dichis? to whom ben woundis with out cause? to whom is puttyng out of iyen?
30 Whether not to hem, that dwellen in wyn, and studien to drynke al of cuppis?
31 Biholde thou not wyn, whanne it sparclith, whanne the colour therof schyneth in a ver.
32 It entrith swetli, but at the laste it schal bite as an eddre doith, and as a cocatrice it schal schede abrood venyms.
33 Thin iyen schulen se straunge wymmen, and thi herte schal speke weiwerd thingis.
34 And thou schalt be as a man slepinge in the myddis of the see, and as a gouernour aslepid, whanne the steere is lost.
35 And thou schalt seie, Thei beeten me, but Y hadde not sorewe; thei drowen me, and Y feelide not; whanne schal Y wake out, and Y schal fynde wynes eft?

CAP 24
1 Sue thou not yuele men, desire thou not to be with hem.
2 For the soule of hem bithenkith raueyns, and her lippis speken fraudis.
3 An hous schal be bildid bi wisdom, and schal be maad strong bi prudence.
4 Celeris schulen be fillid in teching, al riches preciouse and ful fair.
5 A wijs man is strong, and a lerned man is stalworth and miyti.
6 For whi batel is bigunnun with ordenaunce, and helthe schal be, where many counsels ben.
7 Wisdom is hiy to a fool; in the yate he schal not opene his mouth.
8 He that thenkith to do yuels, schal be clepid a fool.
9 The thouyte of a fool is synne; and a bacbitere is abhomynacioun of men.
10 If thou that hast slide, dispeirist in the dai of angwisch, thi strengthe schal be maad lesse.
11 Delyuere thou hem, that ben led to deth; and ceesse thou not to delyuere hem, that ben drawun to deth.
12 If thou seist, Strengthis suffisen not; he that is biholdere of the herte, vndirstondith, and no thing disseyueth the kepere of thi soule, and he schal yelde to a man bi hise werkis.
13 Mi sone, ete thou hony, for it is good; and an honycomb ful swete to thi throte.
14 `So and the techyng of wisdom is good to thi soule; and whanne thou hast founde it, thou schalt haue hope in the laste thingis, and thin hope schal not perische.
15 Aspie thou not, and seke not wickidnesse in the hous of a iust man, nether waste thou his reste.
16 For a iust man schal falle seuene sithis in the dai, and schal rise ayen; but wickid men schulen falle in to yuele.
17 Whanne thin enemye fallith, haue thou not ioye; and thin herte haue not ful out ioiyng in his fal;
18 lest perauenture the Lord se, and it displese hym, and he take awei his ire fro hym.
19 Stryue thou not with `the worste men, nether sue thou wickid men.
20 For whi yuele men han not hope of thingis to comynge, and the lanterne of wickid men schal be quenchid.
21 My sone, drede thou God, and the kyng; and be thou not medlid with bacbiteris.
22 For her perdicioun schal rise togidere sudenli, and who knowith the fal of euer either?
23 Also these thingis that suen ben to wise men. It is not good to knowe a persoone in doom.
24 Puplis schulen curse hem, that seien to a wickid man, Thou art iust; and lynagis schulen holde hem abhomynable.
25 Thei that repreuen iustli synners, schulen be preisid; and blessing schal come on hem.
26 He that answerith riytful wordis, schal kisse lippis.
27 Make redi thi werk with outforth, and worche thi feelde dilygentli, that thou bilde thin hous aftirward.
28 Be thou not a witnesse with out resonable cause ayens thi neiybore; nether flatere thou ony man with thi lippis.
29 Seie thou not, As he dide to me, so Y schal do to him, and Y schal yelde to ech man aftir his werk.
30 I passide bi the feeld of a slow man, and bi the vyner of a fonned man; and, lo!
31 nettlis hadden fillid al, thornes hadden hilid the hiyere part therof, and the wal of stoonys with out morter was distried.
32 And whanne Y hadde seyn this thing, Y settide in myn herte, and bi ensaumple Y lernyde techyng.
33 Hou longe slepist thou, slow man? whanne schalt thou ryse fro sleep? Sotheli thou schalt slepe a litil, thou schalt nappe a litil, thou schalt ioyne togidere the hondis a litil, to take reste;
34 and thi nedynesse as a currour schal come to thee, and thi beggerie as an armed man.

CAP 25
1 Also these ben the Parablis of Salomon, whiche the men of Ezechie, kyng of Juda, translatiden.
2 The glorie of God is to hele a word; and the glorie of kyngis is to seke out a word.
3 Heuene aboue, and the erthe bynethe, and the herte of kyngis is vnserchable.
4 Do thou a wei rust fro siluer, and a ful cleene vessel schal go out.
5 Do thou awei vnpite fro the cheer of the kyng, and his trone schal be maad stidfast bi riytfulnesse.
6 Appere thou not gloriouse bifore the kyng, and stonde thou not in the place of grete men.
7 For it is betere, that it be seid to thee, Stie thou hidur, than that thou be maad low bifore the prince.
8 Brynge thou not forth soone tho thingis in strijf, whiche thin iyen sien; lest aftirward thou maist not amende, whanne thou hast maad thi frend vnhonest.
9 Trete thi cause with thi frend, and schewe thou not priuyte to a straunge man;
10 lest perauenture he haue ioye of thi fal, whanne he hath herde, and ceesse not to do schenschipe to thee. Grace and frenschip delyueren, whiche kepe thou to thee, that thou be not maad repreuable.
11 A goldun pomel in beddis of siluer is he, that spekith a word in his time.
12 A goldun eere ryng, and a schinynge peerle is he, that repreueth a wijs man, and an eere obeiynge.
13 As the coold of snow in the dai of heruest, so a feithful messanger to hym that sente `thilke messanger, makith his soule to haue reste.
14 A cloude and wind, and reyn not suynge, is a gloriouse man, and not fillynge biheestis.
15 A prince schal be maad soft bi pacience; and a soft tunge schal breke hardnesse.
16 Thou hast founde hony, ete thou that that suffisith to thee; lest perauenture thou be fillid, and brake it out.
17 Withdrawe thi foot fro the hous of thi neiybore; lest sum tyme he be fillid, and hate thee.
18 A dart, and a swerd, and a scharp arowe, a man that spekith fals witnessing ayens his neiybore.
19 A rotun tooth, and a feynt foot is he, that hopith on an vnfeithful man in the dai of angwisch,
20 and leesith his mentil in the dai of coold. Vynegre in a vessel of salt is he, that singith songis to the worste herte. As a mouyte noieth a cloth, and a worm noieth a tree, so the sorewe of a man noieth the herte.
21 If thin enemy hungrith, feede thou him; if he thirstith, yyue thou watir to hym to drinke;
22 for thou schalt gadere togidere coolis on his heed; and the Lord schal yelde to thee.
23 The north wind scatereth reynes; and a sorewful face distrieth a tunge bacbitinge.
24 It is betere to sitte in the corner of an hous without roof, than with a womman ful of chidyng, and in a comyn hous.
25 Coold watir to a thirsti man; and a good messanger fro a fer lond.
26 A welle disturblid with foot, and a veyne brokun, a iust man fallinge bifore a wickid man.
27 As it is not good to hym that etith myche hony; so he that is a serchere of maieste, schal be put doun fro glorie.
28 As a citee opyn, and with out cumpas of wallis; so is a man that mai not refreyne his spirit in speking.

CAP 26
1 As snow in somer, and reyn in heruest; so glorie is vnsemeli to a fool.
2 For whi as a brid fliynge ouer to hiy thingis, and a sparowe goynge in to vncerteyn; so cursing brouyt forth with out resonable cause schal come aboue in to sum man.
3 Beting to an hors, and a bernacle to an asse; and a yerde in the bak of vnprudent men.
4 Answere thou not to a fool bi his foli, lest thou be maad lijk hym.
5 Answere thou a fool bi his fooli, lest he seme to him silf to be wijs.
6 An haltinge man in feet, and drinkinge wickidnesse, he that sendith wordis by a fonned messanger.
7 As an haltinge man hath faire leggis in veyn; so a parable is vnsemeli in the mouth of foolis.
8 As he that casteth a stoon in to an heep of mercurie; so he that yyueth onour to an vnwijs man.
9 As if a thorn growith in the hond of a drunkun man; so a parable in the mouth of foolis.
10 Doom determyneth causis; and he that settith silence to a fool, swagith iris.
11 As a dogge that turneth ayen to his spuyng; so is an vnprudent man, that rehersith his fooli.
12 Thou hast seyn a man seme wijs to hym silf; an vnkunnyng man schal haue hope more than he.
13 A slow man seith, A lioun is in the weie, a liounnesse is in the foot pathis.
14 As a dore is turned in his hengis; so a slow man in his bed.
15 A slow man hidith hise hondis vndur his armpit; and he trauelith, if he turneth tho to his mouth.
16 A slow man semeth wysere to hym silf, than seuene men spekynge sentensis.
17 As he that takith a dogge bi the eeris; so he that passith, and is vnpacient, and is meddlid with the chiding of anothir man.
18 As he is gilti, that sendith speris and arowis in to deth;
19 so a man that anoieth gilefuli his frend, and whanne he is takun, he schal seie, Y dide pleiynge.
20 Whanne trees failen, the fier schal be quenchid; and whanne a priuy bacbitere is withdrawun, stryues resten.
21 As deed coolis at quic coolis, and trees at the fier; so a wrathful man reisith chidyngis.
22 The wordis of a pryuei bacbitere ben as symple; and tho comen til to the ynneste thingis of the herte.
23 As if thou wolt ourne a vessel of erthe with foul siluer; so ben bolnynge lippis felouschipid with `the werste herte.
24 An enemy is vndirstondun bi hise lippis, whanne he tretith giles in the herte.
25 Whanne he `makith low his vois, bileue thou not to hym; for seuene wickidnessis ben in his herte.
26 The malice of hym that hilith hatrede gilefuli, schal be schewid in a counsel.
27 He that delueth a diche, schal falle in to it; and if a man walewith a stoon, it schal turne ayen to hym.
28 A fals tunge loueth not treuth; and a slidir mouth worchith fallyngis.

CAP 27
1 Haue thou not glorie on the morewe, `not knowynge what thing the dai to comynge schal bringe forth.
2 Another man, and not thi mouth preise thee; a straunger, and not thi lippis `preise thee.
3 A stoon is heuy, and grauel is chariouse; but the ire of a fool is heuyere than euer eithir.
4 Ire hath no merci, and woodnesse brekynge out `hath no merci; and who mai suffre the fersnesse of a spirit stirid?
5 Betere is opyn repreuyng, than loue hid.
6 Betere ben the woundis of hym that loueth, than the gileful cossis of hym that hatith.
7 A man fillid schal dispise an hony coomb; but an hungri man schal take, yhe, bittir thing for swete.
8 As a brid passinge ouer fro his nest, so is a man that forsakith his place.
9 The herte delitith in oynement, and dyuerse odours; and a soule is maad swete bi the good counsels of a frend.
10 Forsake thou not thi frend, and the frend of thi fadir; and entre thou not in to the hous of thi brothir, in the dai of thi turment. Betere is a neiybore nyy, than a brothir afer.
11 Mi sone, studie thou a boute wisdom, and make thou glad myn herte; that thou maist answere a word to a dispisere.
12 A fel man seynge yuel was hid; litle men of wit passinge forth suffriden harmes.
13 Take thou awei his clooth, that bihiyte for a straunger; and take thou awei a wed fro hym for an alien man.
14 He that blessith his neiybore with greet vois; and risith bi niyt, schal be lijk hym that cursith.
15 Roouys droppynge in the dai of coold, and a womman ful of chidyng ben comparisond.
16 He that withholdith hir, as if he holdith wynd; and auoidith the oile of his riyt hond.
17 Yrun is whettid bi irun; and a man whettith the face of his frend.
18 He that kepith a fige tre, schal ete the fruytis therof; and he that is a kepere of his lord, schal be glorified.
19 As the cheris of men biholdinge schynen in watris; so the hertis of men ben opyn to prudent men.
20 Helle and perdicioun schulen not be fillid; so and the iyen of men moun not be fillid.
21 As siluer is preuyd in a wellyng place, and gold `is preued in a furneys; so a man is preued bi the mouth of preyseris. The herte of a wickid man sekith out yuels; but a riytful herte sekith out kunnyng.
22 Thouy thou beetist a fool in a morter, as with a pestel smytynge aboue dried barli; his foli schal not be don awei fro him.
23 Knowe thou diligentli the cheere of thi beeste; and biholde thou thi flockis.
24 For thou schalt not haue power contynueli; but a coroun schal be youun to thee in generacioun and in to generacioun.
25 Medewis ben openyd, and greene eerbis apperiden; and hey is gaderid fro hillis.
26 Lambren be to thi clothing; and kidis be to the prijs of feeld.
27 The mylke of geete suffice to thee for thi meetis; in to the necessarie thingis of thin hous, and to lijflode to thin handmaidis.

CAP 28
1 A wickid man fleeth, whanne no man pursueth; but a iust man as a lioun tristynge schal be with out ferdfulnesse.
2 For the synnes of the lond ben many princis therof; and for the wisdom of a man, and for the kunnyng of these thingis that ben seid, the lijf of the duyk schal be lengere.
3 A pore man falsli calengynge pore men, is lijk a grete reyn, wherynne hungur is maad redi.
4 Thei that forsaken the lawe, preisen a wickid man; thei that kepen `the lawe, ben kyndlid ayens hym.
5 Wickid men thenken not doom; but thei that seken the Lord, perseyuen alle thingis.
6 Betere is a pore man goynge in his sympilnesse, than a riche man in schrewid weies.
7 He that kepith the lawe, is a wijs sone; but he that fedith glotouns, schendith his fadir.
8 He that gaderith togidere richessis bi vsuris, and fre encrees, gaderith tho togidere ayens pore men.
9 His preyer schal be maad cursid, that bowith awei his eere; that he here not the lawe.
10 He that disseyueth iust men in an yuel weye, schal falle in his perisching; and iuste men schulen welde hise goodis.
11 A ryche man semeth wijs to him silf; but a pore man prudent schal serche him.
12 In enhaunsing of iust men is miche glorie; whanne wickid men regnen, fallyngis of men ben.
13 He that hidith hise grete trespassis, schal not be maad riytful; but he that knoulechith and forsakith tho, schal gete merci.
14 Blessid is the man, which is euere dredeful; but he that is `harde of soule, schal falle in to yuel.
15 A rorynge lioun, and an hungry bere, is a wickid prince on a pore puple.
16 A duyk nedi of prudence schal oppresse many men bi fals chalenge; but the daies of hym that hatith aueryce, schulen be maad longe.
17 No man susteyneth a man that falsly chalengith the blood of a man, if he fleeth `til to the lake.
18 He that goith simpli, schal be saaf; he that goith bi weiward weies, schal falle doun onys.
19 He that worchith his lond, schal be fillid with looues; he that sueth ydelnesse, schal be fillid with nedynesse.
20 A feithful man schal be preisid myche; but he that hastith to be maad riche, schal not be innocent.
21 He that knowith a face in doom, doith not wel; this man forsakith treuthe, yhe, for a mussel of breed.
22 A man that hastith to be maad riche, and hath enuye to othere men; woot not that nedinesse schal come on hym.
23 He that repreueth a man, schal fynde grace aftirward at hym; more than he that disseyueth bi flateryngis of tunge.
24 He that withdrawith ony thing fro his fadir and fro his modir, and seith that this is no synne, is parcener of a manquellere.
25 He that auauntith hym silf, and alargith, reisith stryues; but he that hopith in the Lord, schal be sauyd.
26 He that tristith in his herte, is a fool; but he that goith wiseli,
27 schal be preysid. He that yyueth to a pore man, schal not be nedi; he that dispisith `a pore man bisechynge, schal suffre nedynesse.
28 Whanne vnpitouse men risen, men schulen be hid; whanne tho `vnpitouse men han perischid, iust men schulen be multiplied.

CAP 29
1 Sodeyn perischyng schal come on that man, that with hard nol dispisith a blamere; and helth schal not sue hym.
2 The comynalte schal be glad in the multipliyng of iust men; whanne wickid men han take prinshod, the puple schal weyle.
3 A man that loueth wisdom, makith glad his fadir; but he that nurschith `an hoore, schal leese catel.
4 A iust king reisith the lond; an auerouse man schal distrie it.
5 A man that spekith bi flaterynge and feyned wordis to his frend; spredith abrood a net to hise steppis.
6 A snare schal wlappe a wickid man doynge synne; and a iust man schal preise, and schal make ioye.
7 A iust man knowith the cause of pore men; an vnpitouse man knowith not kunnyng.
8 Men ful of pestilence distryen a citee; but wise men turnen awei woodnesse.
9 If a wijs man stryueth with a fool; whether he be wrooth, `ether he leiyith, he schal not fynde reste.
10 Menquelleris haten a simple man; but iust men seken his soule.
11 A fool bringith forth al his spirit; a wise man dilaieth, and reserueth in to tyme comynge afterward.
12 A prince that herith wilfuli the wordis of a leesyng; schal haue alle mynystris vnfeithful.
13 A pore man and a leenere metten hem silf; the Lord is liytnere of euer ethir.
14 If a kyng demeth pore men in treuthe; his trone schal be maad stidfast with outen ende.
15 A yerde and chastisyng schal yyue wisdom; but a child, which is left to his wille, schendith his modir.
16 Grete trespassis schulen be multiplied in the multipliyng of wickid men; and iust men schulen se the fallyngis of hem.
17 Teche thi sone, and he schal coumforte thee; and he schal yyue delicis to thi soule.
18 Whanne prophesie faylith, the puple schal be distried; but he that kepith the lawe, is blessid.
19 A seruaunt mai not be tauyt bi wordis; for he vndirstondith that that thou seist, and dispisith for to answere.
20 Thou hast seyn a man swift to speke; foli schal be hopid more than his amendyng.
21 He that nurschith his seruaunt delicatli fro childhod; schal fynde hym rebel aftirward.
22 A wrathful man territh chidingis; and he that is liyt to haue indignacioun, schal be more enclynaunt to synnes.
23 Lownesse sueth a proude man; and glorie schal vp take a meke man of spirit.
24 He that takith part with a theef, hatith his soule; he herith a man chargynge greetli, and schewith not.
25 He that dredith a man, schal falle soon; he that hopith in the Lord, shal be reisid.
26 Many men seken the face of the prince; and the doom of alle men schal go forth of the Lord.
27 Iust men han abhomynacioun of a wickid man; and wickid men han abhomynacioun of hem, that ben in a riytful weye. A sone kepynge a word, schal be out of perdicioun.

CAP 30
1 The wordis of hym that gaderith, of the sone spuynge. The prophesie which a man spak, with whom God was, and which man was coumfortid bi God dwellyng with hym,
2 and seide, Y am the moost fool of men; and the wisdom of men is not with me.
3 Y lernede not wisdom; and Y knew not the kunnyng of hooli men.
4 Who stiede in to heuene, and cam doun? Who helde togidere the spirit in hise hondis? who bonde togidere watris as in a cloth? Who reiside alle the endis of erthe? What is name of hym? and what is the name of his sone, if thou knowist?
5 Ech word of God is a scheld set a fiere, to alle that hopen in hym.
6 Adde thou not ony thing to the wordis of hym, and thou be repreued, and be foundun a liere.
7 I preiede thee twei thingis; denye not thou to me, bifor that Y die.
8 Make thou fer fro me vanyte and wordis of leesyng; yyue thou not to me beggery and richessis; yyue thou oneli necessaries to my lijflode;
9 lest perauenture Y be fillid, and be drawun to denye, and seie, Who is the Lord? and lest Y compellid bi nedynesse, stele, and forswere the name of my God.
10 Accuse thou not a seruaunt to his lord, lest perauenture he curse thee, and thou falle doun.
11 A generacioun that cursith his fadir, and that blessith not his modir.
12 A generacioun that semeth cleene to it silf, and netheles is not waischun fro hise filthis.
13 A generacioun whose iyen ben hiy, and the iye liddis therof ben reisid in to hiy thingis.
14 A generacioun that hath swerdis for teeth, and etith with hise wank teeth; that it ete nedi men of erthe, and the porails of men.
15 The watir leche hath twei douytris, seiynge, Brynge, bringe. Thre thingis ben vnable to be fillid, and the fourthe, that seith neuere, It suffisith;
16 helle, and the mouth of the wombe, and the erthe which is neuere fillid with water; but fier seith neuere, It suffisith.
17 Crowis of the stronde picke out thilke iye, that scorneth the fadir, and that dispisith the child beryng of his modir; and the briddis of an egle ete that iye.
18 Thre thingis ben hard to me, and outirli Y knowe not the fourthe thing;
19 the weye of an egle in heuene, the weie of a serpent on a stoon, the weie of a schip in the myddil of the see, and the weie of a man in yong wexynge age.
20 Siche is the weie of a womman auowtresse, which etith, and wipith hir mouth, and seith, Y wrouyte not yuel.
21 The erthe is moued bi thre thingis, and the fourthe thing, which it may not susteyne;
22 bi a seruaunt, whanne he regneth; bi a fool, whanne he is fillid with mete;
23 bi an hateful womman, whanne sche is takun in matrymonye; and bi an handmaide, whanne sche is eir of hir ladi.
24 Foure ben the leeste thingis of erthe, and tho ben wisere than wise men;
25 amtis, a feble puple, that maken redi mete in heruest to hem silf;
26 a hare, a puple vnmyyti, that settith his bed in a stoon;
27 a locust hath no kyng, and al goith out bi cumpanyes; an euete enforsith with hondis,
28 and dwellith in the housis of kingis.
29 Thre thingis ben, that goon wel, and the fourthe thing, that goith richeli.
30 A lioun, strongeste of beestis, schal not drede at the meetyng of ony man;
31 a cok gird the leendis, and a ram, and noon is that schal ayenstonde him.
32 He that apperith a fool, aftir that he is reisid an hiy; for if he hadde vndurstonde, he hadde sett hond on his mouth.
33 Forsothe he that thristith strongli teetis, to drawe out mylk, thristith out botere; and he that smytith greetli, drawith out blood; and he that stirith iris, bringith forth discordis.

CAP 31
1 The wordis of Lamuel, the king; the visioun bi which his modir tauyte hym.
2 What my derlyng? what the derlyng of my wombe? what the derlyng of my desiris?
3 Yyue thou not thi catel to wymmen, and thi richessis to do awei kyngis.
4 A! Lamuel, nyle thou yiue wyn to kingis; for no pryuete is, where drunkenesse regneth.
5 Lest perauenture thei drynke, and foryete domes, and chaunge the cause of the sones of a pore man.
6 Yyue ye sidur to hem that morenen, and wyn to hem that ben of bitter soule.
7 Drinke thei, and foryete thei her nedinesse; and thenke thei no more on her sorewe.
8 Opene thi mouth for a doumb man,
9 and opene thi mouth for the causes of alle sones that passen forth. Deme thou that that is iust, and deme thou a nedi man and a pore man.
10 Who schal fynde a stronge womman? the prijs of her is fer, and fro the laste endis.
11 The herte of hir hosebond tristith in hir; and sche schal not haue nede to spuylis.
12 Sche schal yelde to hym good, and not yuel, in alle the daies of hir lijf.
13 Sche souyte wolle and flex; and wrouyte bi the counsel of hir hondis.
14 Sche is maad as the schip of a marchaunt, that berith his breed fro fer.
15 And sche roos bi nyyt, and yaf prey to hir meyneals, and metis to hir handmaidis.
16 Sche bihelde a feeld, and bouyte it; of the fruyt of hir hondis sche plauntide a vyner.
17 Sche girde hir leendis with strengthe, and made strong hir arm.
18 Sche taastide, and siy, that hir marchaundie was good; hir lanterne schal not be quenchid in the niyt.
19 Sche putte hir hondis to stronge thingis, and hir fyngris token the spyndil.
20 Sche openyde hir hond to a nedi man, and stretchide forth hir hondis to a pore man.
21 Sche schal not drede for hir hous of the cooldis of snow; for alle hir meyneals ben clothid with double clothis.
22 Sche made to hir a ray cloth; bijs and purpur is the cloth of hir.
23 Hir hosebonde is noble in the yatis, whanne he sittith with the senatours of erthe.
24 Sche made lynnun cloth, and selde; and yaf a girdil to a Chananei.
25 Strengthe and fairnesse is the clothing of hir; and sche schal leiye in the laste dai.
26 Sche openyde hir mouth to wisdom; and the lawe of merci is in hir tunge.
27 Sche bihelde the pathis of hir hous; and sche eet not breed idili.
28 Hir sones risiden, and prechiden hir moost blessid; hir hosebonde roos, and preiside hir.
29 Many douytris gaderiden richessis; thou passidist alle.
30 Fairnesse is disseiuable grace, and veyn; thilke womman, that dredith the Lord, schal be preisid.
31 Yyue ye to hir of the fruyt of hir hondis; and hir werkis preise hir in the yatis.
