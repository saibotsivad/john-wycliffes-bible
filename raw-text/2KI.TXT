1 Forsothe Moab trespasside ayens Israel, after that Achab was deed.
2 And Ocozie felde thorou the aleris of his soler, which he hadde in Samarie, and was sijk; and he sente messangeris, and seide to hem, Go ye, and councele Belzebub, god of Acharon, whether Y may lyue after this sijknesse of me.
3 Forsothe the aungel of the Lord spak to Elye of Thesbi, and seide, Rise thou, and go doun into the metynge of the messangeris of the kyng of Samarie; and thou schalt seie to hem, Whether God is not in Israel, that ye go to counsel Belzebub, god of Acharon?
4 For which thing the Lord seith these thingis, Thou schalt not go doun of the bed, on which thou stiedist.
5 And Elie yede. And the messangeris turneden ayen to Ocozie. And he seide to hem, Whi turneden ye ayen?
6 And thei answeriden to hym, A man mette vs, and seide to vs, Go ye, turne ye ayen to the kyng, that sente you; and ye schulen seie to him, The Lord seith these thingis, Whether for God was not in Israel, thou sendist, that Belzebub, god of Acharon, be counselid? Therfor thou schalt not go doun of the bed, on which thou stiedist, but thou schalt die bi deeth.
7 Which Ocozie seide to hem, Of what figure and abite is that man, that mette you, and spak to you these wordis?
8 And thei seiden, An heeri man, and gird with a girdil of skyn in the reynes. Which seide to hem, It is Elie of Thesbi.
9 And he sente to Elie a prince of fifti, and fifti men that weren vndur hym. Which prince stiede to hym, and seide to hym, sittynge in the cop of the hil, Man of God, the kyng comaundith, that thou come doun.
10 And Elie answeride, and seide to the prince of fifti men, If Y am the man of God, fier come doun fro heuene, and deuoure thee and thi fifti men. Therfor fier cam doun fro heuene, and deuouride hym, and the fifti men that weren with hym.
11 Eft he sente to Elie another prince of fifti, and fifti men with hym, which spak to Helye, Man of God, the kyng seith these thingis, Haste thou, come thou doun.
12 Elie answeride, and seide, If Y am the man of God, fier come doun fro heuene, and deuoure thee and thi fifti men. Therfor the fier of God cam doun fro heuene, and deuouride hym and hise fifti men.
13 Eft he sente the thridde prince of fifti men, and fifti men that weren with hym. And whanne this prynce hadde come, he bowide the knees ayens Elie, and preiede hym, and seide, Man of God, nyle thou dispise my lijf, and the lyues of thi seruauntis that ben with me.
14 Lo! fier cam doun fro heuene, and deuouride tweyne, the firste princis of fifti men, and the fifti men that weren with hem; but now, Y biseche, that thou haue mercy on my lijf.
15 Forsothe the aungel of the Lord spak to Helie of Thesbi, and seide, Go thou doun with hym; drede thou not. Therfor Elie roos, and cam doun with hym to the kyng;
16 and he spak to the kyng, The Lord seith thes thingis, For thou sentist messangeris to counsele Belzebub, god of Acharon, as if no God were in Israel, of whom thow myytist axe a word; therfor thou schalt not go doun of the bed, on which thou stiedist, but thou schalt die bi deeth.
17 Therfor he was deed bi the word of the Lord, which word Elie spak; and Joram, hys brothir, regnyde for hym, in the secounde yeer of Joram, the sone of Josephat, kyng of Juda; for Ocozie hadde no sone.
18 Sotheli the residue of wordis of Ocozie, whiche he wrouyte, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Israel?

CAP 2
1 Forsothe it was don, whanne the Lord wolde reise Elie bi a whirlewynd in to heuene, Elie and Elisee yeden fro Galgalis.
2 And Elie seide to Elisee, Sitte thou here, for the Lord sente me til into Bethel. To whom Elisee seide, The Lord lyueth and thi soule lyueth, for Y schal not forsake thee. And whanne thei hadden come doun to Bethel,
3 the sones of prophetis, that weren in Bethel, yeden out to Elisee, and seiden to hym, Whether thou knowist, that the Lord schal take awey thi lord to dai fro thee? Which answeride, And I knowe; be ye stille.
4 Forsothe Elie seide to Elisee, Sitte thou here, for the Lord sente me into Jerico. And he seide, The Lord lyueth and thi soule lyueth, for Y schal not forsake thee. And whanne thei hadden come to Jerico,
5 the sones of prophetis, that weren in Jerico, neiyiden to Elisee, and seiden to hym, Whether thou knowist, that the Lord schal take awei thi lord to dai fro thee? And he seide, Y knowe; be ye stille.
6 Forsothe Elie seide to Elisee, Sitte thou here, for the Lord sente me `til to Jordan. Which seide, The Lord lyueth and thi soule lyueth, for Y schal not forsake thee. Therfor bothe yeden togidere;

8 And Elie took his mentil, and wlappide it, and smoot the watris; whiche weren departid `into euer ethir part, and bothe yeden bi the drie.
9 And whanne thei hadden passid, Elie seide to Elisee, Axe thou that, that thou wolt that Y do to thee, bifor that Y be takun awey fro thee. And Elisee seide, Y biseche, that thi double spirit be `maad in me.
10 Which Elie answeride, Thou axist an hard thing; netheles if thou schalt se me, whanne Y schal be takun awei fro thee, that that thou axidist schal be; sotheli, if thou schalt not se, it schal not be.
11 And whanne thei yeden, and spaken goynge, lo! a chare of fier and horsys of fier departiden euer either; and Elie stiede bi a whirlewynd in to heuene.
12 Forsothe Elise siy, and criede, My fadir! my fadir! the chare of Israel, and the charietere therof. And he siy no more Elie. And he took hise clothis, and to-rente tho in to twei partis.
13 And he reiside the mentil of Elie, that felde doun to hym; and he turnede ayen, and stood ouer the ryuer of Jordan.
14 And with the mentil of Elie, that felde doun to hym, he smoot the watris, whiche weren not departid. And he seide, Where is God of Elie also now? And he smoot the watris, and tho weren departid hidur and thidur; and Elisee passide.
15 Sotheli the sones of prophetis, that weren in Jerico euene ayens, siyen, and seiden, The spirit of Elie restide on Elisee. And thei camen in to the meetyng of hym, and worschipiden hym lowli to erthe.
16 And thei seiden to hym, Lo! with thi seruauntis ben fifti stronge men, that moun go, and seke thi lord, lest perauenture the Spirit of the Lord hath take hym, and hath cast forth hym in oon of the hillis, ethir in oon of the valeys.
17 Which seide, `Nyle ye sende. And thei constreyneden hym, til he assentide to hem, and seide, Sende ye. And thei senten fifti men; and whanne thei hadden souyt bi thre daies, thei founden not.
18 And thei turneden ayen to hym; and he dwelide in Jerico. And he seide to hem, Whether Y seide not to you, Nyle ye sende?
19 Therfor the men of the citee seiden to Elisee, Lo! the dwellyng of this cite is ful good, as thou thi silf, lord, seest; but the watris ben ful yuele, and the lond is bareyn.
20 And he seide, Brynge ye to me a newe vessel, and sende ye salt in to it. And whanne thei hadden brouyt it,
21 he yede out to the welle of watris, and sente salt in to it, and seide, The Lord seith these thingis, Y haue helid these watris, and nethir deeth, nether bareynesse, schal be more in tho.
22 Therfor the watris weren heelid til in to this dai, bi the word of Elisee, which he spak.
23 Forsothe Elisee stiede fro thennus in to Bethel; and whanne he stiede bi the weie, litle children yeden out of the citee, and scorneden hym, and seiden, Stie, thou ballard! stie, thou ballard!
24 And whanne he hadde biholde, he siy hem, and curside hem in the name of the Lord. And twey beeris yeden out of the forest, and to-rente fourti children of hem.
25 Sotheli Elisee wente fro thennus in to the hil of Carmele, and fro thennus he turnede `ayen to Samarie.

CAP 3
1 Forsothe Joram, sone of Achab, regnede on Israel, in Samarie, in the eiytenthe yeer of Josephat, kyng of Juda. And he regnede twelue yeer,
2 and he dide yuel bifor the Lord, but not as his fader and modir;
3 for he took awei the ymagis of Baal, whiche his fadir hadde maad, netheles in the synnes of Jeroboam, sone of Nabath, that made Israel to do synne, `he cleuyde, and yede not awei fro tho.
4 Forsothe Mesa, kyng of Moab, nurschide many beestis, and paiede to the kyng of Israel an hundrid thousynde of lambren, and an hundrid thousynde of wetheris, with her fleesis.
5 And whanne Achab was deed, he brak the boond of pees, which he hadde with the kyng of Israel.
6 Therfor kyng Joram yede out of Samarie in that dai, and noumbride al Israel.
7 And he sente to Josephat, kyng of Juda, and seide, The kyng of Moab yede awei fro me; come thou with me ayens him to batel. Which Josephat answeride, Y schal stie; he that is myn, is thin; my puple is thi puple; and myn horsis ben thin horsis.
8 And he seide, Bi what weie schulen we stie? And he answeride, Bi the deseert of Ydumee.
9 Therfor the kyng of Israel, and the kyng of Juda, and the kyng of Edom, yeden forth, and cumpassiden bi the weie of seuene daies; and `watir was not to the oost, and to the beestis, that sueden hem.
10 And the kyng of Israel seide, Alas! alas! alas! the Lord hath gaderide vs thre kyngis to bitake vs in the hond of Moab.
11 And Josephat seide, Whether ony prophete of the Lord is here, that we biseche the Lord bi hym? And oon of the seruauntis of the kyng of Israel answeride, Elisee, the sone of Saphat, is here, that schedde watir on the hondis of Elie.
12 And Josephat seide, Is the word of the Lord at hym? Whiche seiden, `It is. And the kyng of Israel, and Josephat, kyng of Juda, and the kyng of Edom, yeden doun to hym.
13 Forsothe Elise seide to the kyng of Israel, What is to me and to thee? Go thou to the prophetis of thi fadir and of thi modir. And the kyng of Israel seide to hym, Whi hath the Lord gaderid these thre kyngis, to bitake hem into the hondis of Moab?
14 And Elisee seide to hym, The Lord of oostis lyueth, in whos siyt Y stonde, if Y were not aschamed of the cheer of Josephat, king of Juda, treuli Y hadde not perseyued, nethir Y hadde biholde thee.
15 Now forsothe brynge ye to me a sautrere. And whanne the sautrere song, the hond of the Lord was maad on hym, and he seide, The Lord seith these thingis,
16 Make ye the wombe, ether depthe, of this stronde dichis and dichis.
17 For the Lord seith these thingis, Ye schulen not se wynd, nethir reyn, and this depthe schal be fillid with watris, and ye schulen drynke, and youre meynees, and youre beestis.
18 And this is litil in the siyt of the Lord. Ferthermore also he schal bitake Moab in to youre hondis;
19 and ye schulen smyte ech strengthid citee, and ech chosun citee, and ye schulen kitte doun ech tre berynge fruyt, and ye schulen stoppe alle the wellis of watris, and ye schulen hile with stonys ech noble feeld.
20 Therfor it was doon eerli, whanne sacrifice is wont to be offrid, and, lo! watris camen bi the weie of Edom, and the lond was fillid with watris.
21 Sotheli alle men of Moab herden, that kyngis hadden stied to fiyte ayens hem; `and men of Moab clepiden togidere alle men, that weren gird with girdil aboue, and thei stoden in the termes.
22 And men of Moab risiden ful eerli, and whanne the sunne was risun thanne euen ayens the watris, thei sien the watris reed as blood euene ayens.
23 And thei seiden, It is the blood of swerd, `that is, sched out bi swerd; kyngis fouyten ayens hem silf, and thei ben slayn togider; now go thou, Moab, to the prey.
24 And thei yeden in to the castels of Israel; forsothe Israel roos, and smoot Moab, and thei fledden bifor men of Israel. Therfor thei that hadden ouercome, camen, and smytiden Moab, and destrieden cytees;
25 and alle men sendynge stoonys filliden ech beste feeld, and stoppiden alle the wellis of watris, and kittiden doun alle trees berynge fruyt, so that oneli `wallis maad of erthe weren left; and the citee was cumpassid of men settinge engynes, and was smytun bi greet part.
26 And whanne the kyng of Moab hadde seyn this, that is, that the enemyes hadden the maistrie, he took with hym seuene hundrid men drawynge swerdis, that thei shulden breke in to the kyng of Edom; and thei myyten not.
27 And he took his firste gendrid sone, that schulde regne for hym, and offride brent sacrifice on the wal; and greet indignacioun was maad in Israel; and anoon thei yeden awei fro hym, and turneden ayen in to her lond.

CAP 4
1 Forsothe sum womman of the wyues of prophetys criede to Elisee, and seide, Thi seruaunt, myn hosebonde, is deed, and thou knowist that thi seruaunt dredde God; and lo! the creaunser, `that is, he to whom the dette is owid, cometh to take my two sones to serue hym.
2 To whom Elisee seide, What wolt thou that Y do to thee? seie thou to me, what hast thou in thin hows? And she answeride, Y thin handmayde haue not ony thing in myn hows, no but a litil of oile, bi which Y schal be anoyntid.
3 To whom he seide, Go thou, and axe bi borewyng of alle thi neiyboris voide vessels not fewe.
4 And entre, and close thi dore, whanne thou art with ynne, thou and thi sones; and putte ye therof in to alle these vessels; and whanne tho schulen be ful, thou schalt take awei.
5 Therfor the womman yede, and closide the dore on hir silf and on hir sones, thei brouyten vessels, and sche `heldide in.
6 And whanne the vessels weren fulle, sche seide to hir sone, Brynge thou yit a vessel to me. And he answeride, Y haue not. And the oyle stood.
7 Forsothe sche cam, and schewide to the man of God; and he seide, Go thou, sil thou the oile, and yelde to thi creauncer; forsothe thou and thi children lyue of the residue.
8 Forsothe sum day was maad, and Elisee passide bi a citee, Sunam; sotheli a greet womman was there, which helde hym, that he schulde ete breed. And whanne he passide ofte therbi, `he turnede to hir, that he schulde ete breed.
9 `Which womman seide to hir hosebonde, Y perseyue that this is an hooli man of God, that passith ofte bi vs;
10 therfor make we a litil soler to hym, and putte we therynne a litil bed to hym, and a boord, and a chaier, and a candilstike; that whanne he cometh to vs, he dwelle there.
11 Therfor sum dai was maad, and he cam, and turnede in to the soler, and restide there.
12 And he seide to Giezi, his child, Clepe thou this Sunamyte. And whanne he hadde clepid hir, and sche hadde stonde
13 bifor hym, he seide to his child, Speke thou to hir, Lo! thou hast mynystride to vs bisili in alle thingis; what wolt thou that Y do to thee? Whether thou hast a cause, and wolt that Y speke to the kyng, ether to the prince of the chyualrye? And sche answeride, I dwelle in the myddis of my puple.
14 And he seide, What therfor wole sche that Y do to hir? Giezi seide to hym, Axe thou not, for she hath no sone, and hir hosebonde is eeld.
15 Therfor Elisee comaundide, that he schulde clepe hir. And whanne sche was clepid, and stood bifor the dore,
16 he seide to hir, In this tyme and in this same our, if lijf schal be felow, thou schalt haue a sone in the wombe. And sche answeride, Nyle thou, my lord, the man of God, Y biseche, nyle thou lye to thin hondmaide.
17 And the womman conseyuede, and childide a sone in the tyme, and in the same our, in which Elisee hadde seid.
18 Sotheli the child encreeside; and whanne sum day was, and the child was goon out, and yede to his fadir,
19 and to the repers, he seide to his fadir, Myn heed akith, myn heed akith. And he seide to a child, Take, and lede hym to his modir.
20 And whanne he hadde take, and hadde brouyt hym to his modir, sche settide hym on hir knees `til to myddai, and he was deed.
21 Sotheli she stiede, and leide hym on the litil bed of the man of God, and closide the dore.
22 And sche yede out, and clepide hir hosebonde, and seide, Y biseche, sende thou with me oon of the children, and an asse, and Y schal renne out `til to the man of God, and Y schal turne ayen.
23 And he seide to hir, For what cause goist thou to hym? to dai ben not calendis, nether sabat. And she answeride, Y schal go.
24 And sche sadlide the asse, and comaundide to the child, Dryue thou, and haaste; make thou not tariyng to me in goyng, and do thou this thing which Y comaunde to thee.
25 Therfor sche yede forth, and cam to the man of God, in to the hil of Carmele. And whanne the man of God hadde seyn hir euene ayen, he seide to Giezi, his child, Lo! thilke Sunamyte; go thou therfor in to the metyng of hir,
26 and seie thou to hir, Whether it is doon riytfuli aboute thee, and aboute thin hosebonde, and aboute thi sone? And sche answeride, Riytfuli.
27 And whanne sche hadde come to the man of God, in to the hil, sche took his feet; and Giezi neiyede, that he schulde remoue hir. And the man of God seide, Suffre thou hir; for hir soule is in bitternesse, and the Lord helde priuy fro me, and schewide not to me.
28 And sche seide to hym, Whether I axide my sone of my lord? Whether Y seide not to thee, Scorne thou not me?
29 And he seide to Giezi, Girde thi leendis, and take my staf in thin hond, and go; if a man metith thee, grete thou not hym; and if ony man gretith thee, answere thou not hym; and putte thou my staf on the face of the child.
30 Forsothe the `modir of the child seide, The Lord lyueth and thi soule lyueth, Y schal not leeue, `ether forsake, thee. Therfor he roos, and suede hir.
31 Sotheli Giezi yede bifor hem, and puttide the staaf on the face of the child; and `vois was not, nether wit. And Giezi turnede ayen to the meetyng of hym; and telde to him, and seyde, The child `roos not.
32 Therfor Elisee entride in to the hows, and, lo! the deed child lai in his bed.
33 And he entride, and closide the dore on hym silf, and on the child; and preiede to the Lord.
34 And he stiede, and lay on the child; and he puttide his mouth on the mouth of the child, and hise iyen on the iyen of the child, and hise hondis on the hondis of the child. And he bouwide hym silf on the child; and the fleisch of the child was maad hoot.
35 And he turnede ayen, and walkide in the hows onys hidur and thidur; and Elisee stiede, and lai on the child, and the child yoxide seuene sithis, and openyde the iyen.
36 And he clepide Giezi, and seide to hym, Clepe thou this Sunamyte. And sche was clepid, and entride to hym. And he seide, Take thi sone.
37 She cam, and felde doun to his feet, and worschipide on erthe; and sche took hir sone, and yede out.
38 And Elisee turnede ayen in to Galgala. Forsothe hungur was in the lond, and the sones of prophetis dwelliden bifor hym. And Elisee seide to oon of his children, Set thou a greet pot, and sethe thou potage to the sones of prophetis.
39 And oon yede out in to the feeld to gadere eerbis of the feeld; and he foond as a wilde vyne, and he gaderide therof gourdis of the feeld. And he fillide his mentil, and he turnede ayen, and schredde in to the pot of potage; for he wiste not what it was.
40 Therfor thei helden yn to felowis to ete; and whanne thei hadden taastid of the sething, thei crieden out, and seiden, Deth in the pot! deeth in the pot! thou man of God. And thei miyten not ete. And he seide, Brynge ye meele.
41 And whanne thei hadden brouyt, he puttide in to the pot, and seide, Helde ye to the cumpany, that thei ete; and ony thing of bitternesse was nomore in the pot.
42 Forsothe sum man cam fro the pleyn of Salisa, and bar to the man of God looues of the firste fruytis, ten looues of barli, and newe wheete, in his scrippe. And the man of God seide, Yyue thou to the puple, that it ete.
43 And his mynystre answeride to hym, `Hou myche is this, that Y sette bifor an hundrid men? Eft Elisee seide, Yyue thou to the puple, that it ete; for the Lord seith these thingis, Thei schulen ete, and it shal leeue.
44 Therfor he puttide bifor hem, whiche eeten; and it lefte, bi the word of the Lord.

CAP 5
1 Naaman, prince of the chyualrye of the kyng of Syrie, was a greet man, and worschipid anentis his lord; for bi hym the Lord yaf helthe to Sirie; sotheli he was a strong man and riche, but leprouse.
2 Forsothe theues yede out of Sirie, and ledden prisonere fro the lond of Israel a litil damysele, that was in the seruyce of the wijf of Naaman.
3 `Which damysele seide to hir ladi, `Y wolde, that my lord hadde be at the prophete which is in Samarie; sotheli the prophete schulde haue curid hym of the lepre which he hath.
4 Therfor Naaman entride to his lord, and telde to hym, and seide, A damysel of the lond of Israel spak so and so.
5 Therfor the kyng of Syrie seide to hym, Go thou, and Y schal sende lettris to the kyng of Israel. And whanne he hadde go forth, and hadde take with hym ten talentis of siluer, and sixe thousynde goldun platis, `ether floreyns, and ten chaungyngis of clothis,
6 he brouyte lettris to the kyng of Israel bi these wordis; Whanne thou hast take this pistle, wite thou, that Y haue sent to thee Naaman, my seruaunt, that thou cure hym of his lepre.
7 And whanne the kyng of Israel hadde red the lettris, he to-rente his clothis, and seide, Whether Y am God, that may sle and quykene, for this kyng sente to me, that Y cure a man of his lepre? Perseyue ye, and se, that he sekith occasiouns ayens me.
8 And whanne Elisee, the man of God, hadde herd this, that is, that the kyng of Israel hadde to-rente hise clothis, he sente to the kyng, and seide, Whi to-rentist thou thi clothis? come he to me, and wite he, that a prophete is in Israel.
9 Therfor Naaman cam with horsis and charis, and stood at the dore of the hows of Elisee.
10 And Elisee sente to hym a messanger, and seide, Go thou, and be thou waischun seuensithis in Jordan; and thi fleisch shal resseyue helthe, and thou schalt be clensid.
11 Naaman was wrooth, and yede awei, and seide, Y gesside, that he schulde go out to me, and that he schulde stonde, and clepe the name of `the Lord his God, and that he schulde touche with his hond the place of lepre, and schulde cure me.
12 Whether Abana and Pharphar, floodis of Damask, ben not betere than alle the watris of Israel, that Y be waischun in tho, and be clensid?
13 Therfor whanne he hadde turned hym silf, and yede awei, hauynge indignacioun, hise seruauntis neiyiden to hym, and spaken to hym, Fadir, thouy the prophete hadde seid to thee a greet thing, certis thou owist to do; hou myche more for now he seide to thee, Be thou waischun, and thou schalt be clensid.
14 He yede doun, and waischide hym seuensithis in Jordan, bi the word of the man of God; and his fleisch was restored as the fleisch of a litil child, and he was clensid.
15 And he turnede ayen with al his felouschipe to the man of God, and cam, and stood bifor hym; and seide, Verili Y knowe, that noon other God is in al erthe, no but oneli God of Israel; therfor, Y biseche, that thou take blessyng of thi seruaunt.
16 And he answeride, The Lord lyueth bifor whom Y stonde, for Y schal not take. And whanne he made `strengthe, that is, greet preier, Elisee assentide not outirli.
17 Therfor Naaman seide, As thou wolt; but, I biseche, graunte thou to me, thi seruaunt, that Y take of `the lond the birthun of twei burdones; for thi seruaunt schal no more make brent sacrifice, ether slayn sacrifice, to alien goddis, no but to the Lord.
18 Forsothe this thing is oneli, of which thou schalt preie the Lord for thi seruaunt, whanne my lord shal entre into the temple of Remmon, that he worschipe, and while he `schal lene on myn hond, if Y worschipe in the temple of Remmon, while he worschipith in the same place, that the Lord foryyue to thi seruaunt for this thing.
19 Which Elisee seide to hym, Go thou in pees. `Therfor he yede fro Elisee in a chosun tyme of the lond.
20 And Giezi, the child of the man of God, seide, My lord sparide this Naaman of Syrie, that he took not of hym that, that he brouyte; the Lord lyueth, for Y schal renne aftir hym, and Y schal take of hym sum thing.
21 And Giezi suede aftir the bak of Naaman; and whanne Naaman hadde seyn Giezi rennynge to hym, he skippide doun of the chare in to the metyng of Giezi; and seide, Whether alle thingis ben riytfuli?
22 And he seide, Riytfuli; my lord sente me to thee, and seide, Twey yonge men of the hille of Effraym, of the sones of prophetis, camen now to me; yyue thou to hem a talent of siluer, and double chaungyng clothis.
23 And Naaman seide, It is betere that thou take twei talentis. And Naaman constreynede hym; and Naaman boond twei talentis of siluer in twei sackis, and double clothis, and puttide on his twey children, `that is, seruauntis, whiche also baren bifor Giezi.
24 And whanne he hadde come thanne in the euentid, he took fro the hond of hem, and leide vp in the hows; and he delyuerede the men, and thei yeden.
25 Forsothe Giezi entride, and stood bifor his lord. And Elise seide, Giezi, fro whennus comest thou? Which answeride, Thi seruaunt yede not to ony place.
26 And Elise seide, Whether myn herte was not in present, whanne the man turnede ayen fro his chare in to the metyng of thee? Now therfor thou hast take siluer, and thou hast take clothis, that thou bie places of olyues, and vyneris, and scheep, and oxis, and seruauntis, and handmaydis;
27 but also the lepre of Naaman schal cleue to thee, and to thi seed withouten ende. And Giezi yede leprouse as snow, `fro hym.

10 Therfor the kyng of Israel sente to the place, which the man of God hadde seid to him, and bifor ocupiede it, and kepte hym silf there not onys, nether twies.
11 And the herte of the kyng of Sirie was disturblid for this thing; and whanne hise seruauntis weren clepide togidere, he seide, Whi schewen ye not to me, who is my tretour anentis the kyng of Israel?
12 And oon of hise seruauntis seide, Nay, my lord the kyng, but Elisee, the prophete, which is in Israel, schewith to the kyng of Israel alle thingis, what euer thingis thou spekist in thi closet.
13 And the kyng seide to hem, `Go ye, and se, where he is, that Y sende, and take hym. And thei telden to him, and seiden, Lo! he dwellith in Dothaym.
14 And the kyng sente thidur horsis, and charis, and the strengthe of the oost; whiche, whanne thei hadden come bi nyyt, cumpassiden the citee.

16 And he answeride, Nile thou drede; for mo ben with vs than with hem.
17 And whanne Elisee hadde preied, he seide, Lord, opene thou the iyen of this child, that he se. And the Lord openyde the iyen of the child, and he siy. And, lo! the hil ful of horsis, and of charis of fier, in the cumpas of Elisee.

20 And whanne thei hadden entrid into Samarie, Elisee seide, Lord, opene thou the iyen of these men, that thei see. And the Lord openyde her iyen, and thei siyen, that thei weren in the myddis of Samarie.
21 And the kyng of Israel, whanne he hadde seyn hem, seide to Elisee, My fadir, whether Y schal smyte hem?
22 And he seide, Thou schalt not smyte hem, for thou hast not take hem bi thi swerd and bouwe, that thou smyte hem; but sette thou breed and watir bifor hem, that thei ete and drynke, and go to her lord.
23 And `greet makyng redi of metis was set forth to hem; and thei eten, and drunken. And the kyng lefte hem, and thei yeden to her lord; and theues of Sirie camen no more in to the lond of Israel.
24 Forsothe it was don after these thingis, Benadab, king of Sirie, gaderide alle his oost, and stiede, and bisegide Samarie.

29 Therfor we setheden my sone, and eten him. And Y seide to hir in the tother day, Yyue thi sone, that we ete hym; and she hidde hir sone.
30 And whanne the kyng hadde herd this, he to-rente hise clothis, and passide bi the wal; and al the puple siy the heire, `with which the kyng was clothid at the fleisch with ynne.
31 And the kyng seide, God do to me these thingis, and adde these thingis, if the heed of Elise, sone of Saphat, schal stonde on hym to dai.
32 Sotheli Elisee sat in his hows, and elde men saten with hym; `therfor he biforsente a man, and bifor that thilke messanger cam, Elisee seide to the elde men, Whether ye witen, that the sone of manquellere sente hidur, that myn heed be gird of? Therfor se ye, whanne the messanger cometh, close ye the dore, and `suffre ye not hym to entre; for, lo! the sown of the feet of his lord is bihynde hym.
33 And yit `while he spak to hem, the messanger that cam to hym apperide; and the kyng seide, Lo! so greet yuel is of the Lord; sotheli what more schal Y abide of the Lord?

And he answeride, For Y woot what yuelis thou schalt do to the sones of Israel; thou schalt brenne bi fier the strengthid citees of hem, and thou schalt sle bi swerd the yonge men of hem, and thou schalt hurtle doun the litle children of hem, and thou schalt departe the women with childe.
13 And Azael seide, What sotheli am Y, thi seruaunt, a dogge, that Y do this grete thing? And Elisee seide, The Lord schewide to me that thou schalt be kyng of Sirie.
14 And whanne he hadde departid fro Elisee, he cam to his lord; which seide to Azael, What seide Elisee to thee? And he answeride, Elisee seide to me, Thou schalt resseyue helthe.
15 And whanne `the tother day hadde come, Azael took the cloth on the bed, and bischedde with watir, and spredde abrood on the face of hym; and whanne he was deed, Azael regnede for hym.

27 Forsothe Ocozie, king of Juda, siy this, and fledde bi the weie of the hows of the gardyn; and Hieu pursuede hym, and seide, Also smyte ye this man in his chare. And thei smytiden hym in the stiyng of Gaber, which is bisidis Jeblaam; and he fledde into Mageddo, and was deed there.
28 And hise seruauntis puttiden hym on his chare, and brouyten hym in to Jerusalem; and thei birieden hym in a sepulcre with hise fadris, in the citee of Dauid.
29 In the eleuenthe yeer of Joram, sone of Achab, kyng of Israel, Ocozie regnede on Juda.

31 and sche bihelde bi a wyndow Hieu entrynge bi the yate, and sche seide, Whether pees may be to Zamri, that kyllide his lord?
32 And Hieu reiside his face to the wyndow, and seide, What womman is this? And tweyne ether thre chaumbirleyns bowiden hem silf to hym, and seiden to hym, This is thilke Jezabel.
33 And he seide to hem, Caste ye hir doun. And thei `castiden doun hir; and the wal was bispreynt with blood, and the howues of horsis, that `to tredden hir.
34 And whanne he hadde entrid to ete and drynke, he seide, Go ye, and se thilke cursid womman, and birie ye hir, for sche is a kyngis douyter.
35 And whanne thei hadden go to birie hir, thei founden not, no but the sculle, and the feet, and the endis of hondis;

Which yaf his hond to hym; and he reiside hym to hym silf in to the chare.
16 And he seide to hym, Come thou with me, and se my feruent loue for the Lord.
17 And he ledde hym, put in hys chare, in to Samarie. And he killide alle men that weren residue of Achab in Samarie `til to oon, bi the word of the Lord, which he spak bi Elie.
18 Therfor Hieu gaderide to gidere alle the puple, and seide to hem, Achab worschipide Baal a litil, but Y schal worschipe hym more.
19 Now therfor clepe ye to me alle the prophetis of Baal, and alle hise seruauntis, and alle hise preestis; `noon be that come not, for grete sacrifice is of me to Baal; who euer schal faile, he schal not lyue. Forsothe Hieu dide this bi tresoun, that he schulde distrie alle the worschipers of Baal.
20 And he seide, Halewe ye a solempne day to Baal.
21 And he clepide, and sente in to alle the termes of Israel; and alle the seruauntis of Baal camen, `noon was residue, and sotheli `not oon was that cam not. And thei entriden in to the temple of Baal; and the hows of Baal was fillid, fro oon ende `til to `the tothir.
22 And he seide to hem that weren souereyns ouer the clothis, Bringe ye forth clothis to alle the seruauntis of Baal; and thei brouyten forth clothis to hem.
23 And Hieu entride, and Jonadab, the sone of Rechab, in to the temple of Baal. And Hieu seide to the worschiperis of Baal, Enquere ye, and se, lest perauenture ony of the seruauntis of the Lord be with you; but that the seruauntis be aloone of Baal.
24 Therfor thei entriden, to make slayn sacrifices, and brent sacrifices. Sotheli Hieu hadde maad redi to hym with outforth foure scoore men, and hadde seid to hem, Who euer schal fle of alle these, whiche Y schal brynge in to youre hondis, the lijf of hym schal be for the lijf of hym that ascapith.
25 Forsothe it was don, whanne the brent sacrifice was fillid, Hieu comaundide to hise knyytis and duykis, Entre ye, and sle hem, that noon ascape. And the knyytis and duykis smytiden `hem bi the scharpnesse of swerd, and castiden forth. And `thei yeden into the citee of the temple of Baal,
26 and thei brouyten forth the ymage fro the temple of Baal,
27 and brenten it, and al to braken it. Also thei destrieden the hows of Baal, and maden priuyes for it `til in to this dai.
28 Therfor Hieu dide awei Baal fro Israel;
29 netheles he yede not awei fro the synnes of Jeroboam, sone of Nabath, that made Israel to do synne, nether he forsook the goldun caluys, that weren in Bethel and in Dan.
30 Forsothe the Lord seide to Hieu, For thou didist bisili that that was riytful, and pleside in myn yyen, and hast do ayens the hows of Achab alle thingis that weren in myn herte, thi sones `til to the fourthe generacioun schulen sitte on the trone of Israel.
31 Forsothe Hieu kepte not, that he yede in the lawe of the Lord God of Israel in al his herte; for he yede not awei fro the synnes of Jeroboam, that made Israel to do synne.
32 In tho daies the Lord bigan to be anoyed on Israel; and Asahel smoot hem in alle the coostis of Israel,
33 fro Jordan ayens the eest coost, al the lond of Galaad, and of Gad, and of Ruben, and of Manasses, fro Aroer which is on the stronde of Arnon, and Galaad, and Baasan.
34 Forsothe the residue of wordis of Hieu, and alle thingis whiche he dide, and his strengthe, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Israel?
35 And Hieu slepte with hise fadris; and thei birieden hym in Samarie; and Joachaz, his sone, regnyde for hym.
36 Forsothe the daies, in whiche Hieu regnede on Israel in Samarie, ben eiyte and twenti yeer.

5 And he comaundide to hem, and seide, This is the word, which ye owen to do;

7 Forsothe twei partis of you alle goynge out in the sabat, kepe ye the wakyngis of the hows of the Lord aboute the kyng.
8 And ye schulen cumpasse hym, and ye schulen haue armeris in youre hondis; forsothe if ony man entrith in to the closyng of the temple, be he slayn; and ye schulen be with the kyng goynge in and goynge out.
9 And the centuriouns diden bi alle thingis whiche Joiada, the preest, hadde comaundid to hem; and alle takynge her men that entriden to the sabat, with hem that yeden out fro the sabat, camen to Joiada, the preest.
10 Which yaf to hem speris, and armeris of kyng Dauid, that weren in the hows of the Lord.
11 And alle stoden hauynge armeris in her hond, fro the riyt side of the temple `til to the left side of the auter and of the hows, aboute the kyng.
12 And he brouyte forth the sone of the kyng, and puttide on hym a diademe, and witnessyng; and thei maden hym kyng, and anoyntiden hym; and thei beeten with the hoond, and seiden, The kyng lyue!
13 Forsothe Athalia herde the vois of the puple rennynge, and sche entride to the cumpenyes in to the temple of the Lord,
14 and sche siy the kyng stondynge on the trone bi custom, and syngeris, and cumpenyes nyy hym, and al the puple of the lond beynge glad, and syngynge with trumpis. And sche to-rente hir clothis, and criede, `Swerynge togidere! swerynge togidere! ether tresoun.
15 Forsothe Joiada comaundide to the centuriouns, that weren on the oost, and seide to hem, Lede ye hir out of the closyngis of the temple; and who euer sueth hir, be smytun with swerd. Forsothe the preest seide, Be sche not slayn in the temple of the Lord.
16 And thei puttiden hondis on hir, and hurliden hir bi the weie of the entryng of horsis bisidis the paleis; and sche was slayn there.
17 Therfor Joiada made boond of pees bitwixe the Lord and the kyng, and bitwixe the puple, that it schulde be the puple of the Lord; and bitwixe the kyng and the puple.
18 Al the puple of the lond entride in to the temple of Baal; and thei distrieden the auteris of hym, and al tobraken strongli the ymagis; and thei killiden bifore the auter Mathan, the preest of Baal. And the preest settide kepyngis in the hows of the Lord; and he took centuriouns, and the legiouns of Cerethi and Pherethi, and al the puple of the lond.
19 And thei ledden forth the kyng fro the hows of the Lord; and thei camen bi the weie of the yate of makeris of scheldis in to the paleis; and he sat on the trone of kyngis.
20 And al the puple of the lond was glad, and the citee restide. Forsothe Athalia was slayn bi swerd in the hows of the kyng.

2 And Joas dide riytfulnesse bifor the Lord in alle the daies, in whiche Joiada, the preest, tauyte hym.
3 Netheles he dide noyt awey hiy thingis; for yit the puple made sacrifice, and brente encense in hiye thingis.
4 And Joas seide to the preestis, `Preestis bi her ordre take al that money of hooli thingis, which is brouyt of men passyng forth in to the temple of the Lord, `which money is offrid for the prijs of soule, and `which money thei bryngen wilfuli, and bi the fredom of her herte, in to the temple of the Lord.
5 And `the preestis reparele the hilyngis of the hows, if thei seen ony thing nedeful in reparelyng.
6 Therfor the preestis repareliden not the hilyngis of the temple, `til to the thre and twentithe yeer of kyng Joas.
7 And Joas, the kyng, clepide Joiada, the bischop, and the prestis, and seide to hem, Whi han ye not reparelid the hilyngis of the temple? Therfor nyle ye more take money bi youre ordre, but yelde it to the reparacioun of the temple.
8 And the prestis weren forbodun to take more the money of the puple, and to reparele the hilyngis of the hows.
9 And Joiada, the bischop, took a cofere of tresorie, and openyde an hole aboue, and settide it bisidis the auter, at the riytside of men entrynge in to the hows of the Lord; and preestis, that kepten the doris, senten in it al the money that was brouyt to the temple of the Lord.
10 And whanne thei sien that ful myche money was in the tresorie, the scryuen of the kyng and the bischop stieden, and schedden it out, and thei noumbriden the money that was founden in the hous of the Lord.
11 And thei yauen it bi noumbre and mesure in the hond of hem, that weren souereyns to the masouns of the hows of the Lord, whiche `spendiden that money in `crafti men of trees, and in these masouns, that wrouyten in the hous of the Lord,
12 and maden the hilyngis, and in these men that hewiden stoonys; and that thei schulden bie trees and stoonys, that weren hewid doun; so that the reparacioun of the hows of the Lord was fillid in alle thingis, that nediden cost to make strong the hows.
13 Netheles water pottis of the temple of the Lord weren not maad of the same money, and fleischokis, and censeris, and trumpis; ech vessel of gold and of siluer weren not maad of the money, that was brouyt in to the temple of the Lord.
14 For it was youun to hem that maden werk, that the temple of the Lord schulde be reparelid.
15 And rekenyng was not maad to these men that token monei, that thei schulden deele it to crafti men; but thei tretiden it in feith.
16 Sotheli thei brouyten not in to the temple of the Lord the money for trespas, and the money for synnes, for it was the preestis.
17 Thanne Asael, kyng of Sirie, stiede, and fauyte ayen Geth; and he took it, and dresside his face, that he schulde stie in to Jerusalem.
18 Wherfor Joas, kyng of Juda, took alle `thingis halewid, whiche Josephat hadde halewid, and Joram, and Ocozie, fadris of hym, kyngis of Juda, and whiche thingis he hadde offrid, and al the siluer, that myyte be foundun in the tresours of the temple of the Lord, and in the paleis of the kyng.

14 Forsothe Elisee was sijk in sikenesse, bi which and he was deed; and Joas, kyng of Israel, yede doun to hym, and wepte bifor hym, and seide, My fadir! my fadir! the chare of Israel, and the charietere therof!
15 And Elisee seide to hym, Brynge thou a bouwe and arowis. And whanne he hadde brouyte to Elisee a bouwe and arowis,
16 he seide to the kyng of Israel, Set thin hond on the bouwe. And whanne he hadde set his hond, Elisee settide his hondis on the hondis of the
17 kyng, and seide, Opene thou the eest wyndow. And whanne he hadde openyd, Elisee seide, Schete thou an arewe; and he schete. And Elisee seide, It is an arewe of helthe of the Lord, and an arowe of helthe ayens Sirie; and thou schalt smyte Sirie in Affeth, til thou waste it.
18 And Elisee seide, Take awei the arowis. And whanne he hadde take awei, Elisee seide eft to him, Smyte thou the erthe with a dart. And whanne he hadde smyte thre tymes,
19 and hadde stonde, the man of God was wrooth ayens hym, and seide, If thou haddist smyte fyue sithis, ether sixe sithis, ethir seuen sithis, thou schuldist haue smyte Sirie `til to the endyng; now forsothe thou schalt smyte it thre sithis.
20 Therfor Elisee was deed, and thei birieden hym. And the theuys of Moab camen in to the lond in that yeer.

33 he was of fyue and twenti yeer, whanne he bigan to regne, and he regnede sixtene yeer in Jerusalem; the name of his modir was Jerusa, the douyter of Sadoch.
34 And he dide that, that was plesaunt bifor the Lord; he wrouyte bi alle thingis, whiche his fadir Ozie hadde do;

36 Forsothe the residue of wordis of Joathan, and alle thingis whiche he dide, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Juda?
37 In tho daies the Lord bigan to sende in to Juda Rasyn, the kyng of Sirie, and Phacee, the sone of Romelie.
38 And Joathan slepte with hise fadris, and was biried with hem in the citee of Dauid, his fadir; and Achaz, his sone, regnyde for hym.

CAP 16
1 In the seuententhe yeer of Phacee, sone of Romelie, Achaz, the sone of Joathan, kyng of Juda, regnyde.
2 Achaz was of twenti yeer, whanne he bigan to regne, and he regnyde sixtene yeer in Jerusalem; he dide not that, that was plesaunt in the siyt of his Lord God, as Dauid, his fadir dide, but he yede in the weie of the kyngis of Israel.
3 Ferthermore and he halewide his sone, and bar thorouy the fier, bi the idols of hethene men, whiche the Lord distriede bifore the sones of Israel.
4 And he offride sacrifices, and brente encense in hiy placis, and in hillis, and vndur ech tree ful of bowis.
5 Thanne Rasyn, kyng of Sirye, and Phacee, sone of Romelie, kyng of Israel, stiede in to Jerusalem to fiyte; and whanne thei bisegide Achaz, thei miyten not ouercome hym.
6 In that tyme Rasyn, kyng of Sirie, restoride Ahila to Sirie, and castide out Jewis fro Ahila; and Ydumeis and men of Sirie camen into Ahila, and dwelliden there til in to this dai.
7 Forsothe Achaz sente messangeris to Teglat Phalasar, kyng of Assiriens, and seide, Y am thi seruaunt and thi sone; stie thou, and make me saaf fro the hond of the kyng of Sirie, and fro the hond of the kyng of Israel, that han rise togidere ayens me.
8 And whanne Achaz hadde gaderide togidere siluer and gold, that myyte be foundun in the hows of the Lord, and in the tresours of the kyng, he sente yiftis to the kyng of Assiriens;
9 whiche assentide to his wille. Sotheli the kyng of Asseriens stiede in to Damask, and wastide it, and translatide the dwelleris therof to Sirenen; sotheli he killide Rasyn.
10 And kyng Achaz yede in to metyng to Teglat Phalasaar, kyng of Assiriens; and whanne kyng Achaz hadde seyn the auter of Damask, he sent to Vrie, the preest, the saumpler and licnesse therof, bi al the werk therof.
11 And Vrie, the preest, bildide an auter bi alle thingis whiche king Achaz hadde comaundid fro Damask, so dide the preest Vrie, til kyng Achaz cam fro Damask.
12 And whanne the king cam fro Damask, he siy the auter, and worschipide it; and he stiede, and offride brent sacrifices, and his sacrifice;
13 and he offride moist sacrifices, and he schedde the blood of pesible thingis, which he hadde offrid on the auter.
14 Forsothe he dide awei the brasun auter, that was bifor the Lord, fro the face of the temple, and fro the place of the auter, and fro the place of the temple of the Lord; and settide it on the side of the auter `at the north.
15 Also kyng Achaz comaundide to Vrie, the preest, and seide, Offre thou on the more auter the brent sacrifice of the morewtid, and the sacrifice of euentid, and the brent sacrifice of the king, and the sacrifice of hym, and the brent sacrifice of al the puple of the lond, and the sacrifices of hem, and the moist sacrifices of hem; and thou schalt schede out on that al the blood of brent sacrifice, and al the blood of slayn sacrifice; sotheli the brasun auter schal be redi at my wille.
16 Therfor Vrie, the preest, dide bi alle thingis whiche kyng Achaz hadde comaundid to hym.
17 Forsothe kyng Achaz took the peyntid foundementis, and the waischyng vessel, that was aboue, and he puttide doun the see, that is, the waischung vessel `for preestis, fro the brasun oxis, that susteyneden it, and he settide on the pawment araied with stoon.
18 Also he turnede the tresorie of sabat, which he hadde bildid in the temple, and `he turnede the entryng of the kyng with outforth, in to the temple of the Lord for the kyng of Assiriens.
19 Forsothe the residue of wordis of Achaz, and alle thingis whiche he dide, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Juda?
20 And Achaz slepte with hise fadris, and was biried with hem in the citee of Dauid; and Ezechie, his sone, regnede for hym.

CAP 17
1 Yn the tweluethe yeer of Achaz, kyng of Juda, Osee, sone of Hela, regnyde in Samarie on Israel nyne yeer.
2 And he dide yuel bifor the Lord, but not as the kyngis of Israel, that weren bifor hym.
3 Salmanasar, kyng of Assiriens, stiede ayens this Osee, and Osee was maad seruaunt to hym, and yildide tributis to hym.
4 And whanne the kyng of Assiriens hadde perseyued, that Osee he enforside to be rebelle, and hadde sent messangeris to Sua, kyng of Egipt, that he schulde not yyue tributis to the kyng of Assiriens, as he was wont bi alle yeeris, `the kyng of Assiriens bisegide hym, and sente him boundun in to prisoun.
5 And he yede thoruy al the lond, and he stiede to Samarie, and bisegide it bi thre yeer.
6 Forsothe in the nynthe yeer of Osee, the kyng of Assiriens took Samarie, and translatide Israel in to Assiriens; and he puttide hem in Hela, and in Thabor, bisidis the flood Gozam, in the citee of Medeis.
7 Forsothe it was don, whanne the sones of Israel hadden synned bifor her Lord God, that ledde hem out of the lond of Egipt, fro the hond of Farao, kyng of Egipt, thei worschipeden alien goddis;
8 and yeden bi the custom of hethene men, whiche the Lord hadde wastid in the siyt of the sones of Israel, and of the kyngis of Israel, for thei hadden do in lijk maner.
9 And the sones of Israel offendiden her Lord God bi wordis not riytful, and thei bildiden to hem silf hiy thingis in alle her citees, fro the tour of keperis `til to a strengthid citee.
10 And thei maden to hem ymagis, and wodis, in ech hiy hil, and vndur ech tree ful of bowis;
11 and thei brenten there encence on the auteris bi the custom of hethene men, whiche the Lord hadde translatid fro the face of hem. And thei diden werste wordis, and thei wraththiden the Lord;
12 and worschipiden vnclenesses, of whiche the Lord comaundide to hem, that thei schulden not do this word.
13 And the Lord witnesside in Israel and in Juda, bi the hond of alle prophetis and seeris, and seide, Turne ye ayen fro youre werste weies, and kepe ye my comaundementis, and ceremonyes, bi al the lawe whiche Y comaundide to youre fadris, and as Y sente to you in the hond of my seruauntis prophetis.
14 Whiche herden not, but maden hard her nol bi the nol of her fadris, that nolden obeie to her Lord God.
15 And thei castiden, awei the lawful thingis of hym, and the couenaunt which he couenauntide with her fadris, and the witnessyngis bi whiche he witnesside to hem; and thei sueden vanytees, `that is, idols, and diden veynli; and sueden hethene men, that weren `bi the cumpas of hem; of whiche vanytees the Lord comaundide to hem, that thei schulden not do as also tho hethene men diden.
16 And thei forsoken alle the comaundementis of her Lord God, and thei maden to hem twei yotun calues, and wodis, and worschipiden al the knyythod of heuene; and thei seruyden Baal, and halewiden to hym her sones,
17 and her douytris thoruy fier, and thei seruyden to fals dyuynyng, and to dyuynyng bi chiterynge of briddis; and thei yauen hem silf to do yuel bifor the Lord, and thei wraththiden hym.
18 And the Lord was wrooth greetli to Israel; and he took awei hem fro his siyt, and noon lefte, no but the lynage of Juda oneli.
19 But nether Juda hym silf kepte the heestis of `his Lord God, netheles he erride, and yede in the errour of Israel, whiche it wrouyte.
20 And the Lord castide awei al the seed of Israel, and turmentide hem, and bitook hem in the hond of rauynouris; til he castide awei hem fro his face,
21 fro that tyme in which Israel was departid fro the hous of Dauid, and maden to hem a kyng, Jeroboam, sone of Nabath. For Jeroboam departide Israel fro the Lord, and made hem to do a greet synne.
22 And the sones of Israel yeden in alle the synnes of Jeroboam, whiche he hadde do; and thei departiden not fro tho synnes,
23 til the Lord dide awei Israel fro his face, as he spak in the hond of alle hise seruauntis prophetis; and Israel was translatid fro his lond in to Assiriens til in to this dai.
24 Forsothe the kyng of Assiriens brouyte puple fro Babiloyne, and fro Cutha, and fro Hailath, and fro Emath, and fro Sepharuaym, and settide hem in the citees of Samarie for the sones of Israel; whiche hadden in possessioun Samarie, and dwelliden in the citees therof.
25 And whanne thei bigunnen to dwelle there, thei dredden not the Lord; and the Lord sente to hem liouns, that killiden hem.
26 And it was teld to the kyng of Assiriens, and was seid, The folkis whiche thou translatidist, and madist to dwelle in the citees of Samarie, kunnen not the lawful thingis of God of the lond; and the Lord sente liouns in to hem, and lo! liouns sleen hem; for thei kunnen not the custom of God of the lond.
27 Sotheli the kyng of Assiriens comaundide, and seide, Lede ye thidur oon of the preestis, whiche ye brouyten prisoneris fro thennus, that he go, and dwelle with hem, and teche hem the lawful thingis of God of the lond.
28 Therfor whanne oon of these preestis had come, that weren led prisoneris fro Samarie, he dwellide in Bethel, and tauyte hem, how thei schulden worschipe the Lord.
29 And ech folk made his god, and thei settiden tho goddis in the hiy templis, whiche the men of Samarie hadden maad, folk and folk in her citees, in whiche thei dwelliden.
30 For men of Babiloyne maden Socoth Benoth; forsothe men of Cutha maden Vergel; and men of Emath maden Asyma;
31 forsothe Eueis maden Nabaath and Tharcha; sotheli thei that weren of Sepharuaym brenten her sones in fier to Adramelech and Anamelech, goddis of Sepharuaym.
32 And netheles thei worschipiden the Lord; forsothe of the laste men thei maden preestis of the hiye thingis, and settiden hem in hiye templis.
33 And whanne thei worschipiden God, thei serueden also her goddis, bi the custom of hethene men, fro whiche thei weren translatid to Samarie;
34 `til in to present dai thei suen the eld custom; thei dredden not the Lord, nethir thei kepen hise cerymonyes, and domes, and lawe, and comaundement, which the Lord comaundide to the sones of Jacob, whom he nemyde Israel;
35 and he smoot a couenaunt with hem, and comaundide to hem, and seide, Nyle ye drede alien goddis, and onoure ye not outwardli hem, nethir worschipe ye inwardli hem, and make ye not sacrifice to hem;
36 but youre Lord God, that ledde you out of the lond of Egipt in greet strengthe, and in arm holdun forth, drede ye hym, and worschipe ye hym, and make ye sacrifice to hym.
37 And kepe ye the cerymonyes, and domes, and the lawe, and comaundement, which he wroot to you, that ye do in alle daies; and drede ye not alien goddis.
38 And nyle ye foryete the couenaunt, which he smoot with you, nether worschipe ye alien goddis;
39 but drede ye youre Lord God, and he schal delyuere you fro the hond of alle youre enemyes.
40 Forsothe thei herden not, but diden bi her formere custom.
41 Therfor these hethene men dredden sotheli God; but netheles thei serueden also her idols, for bothe her sones and the sones of sones doen so, til in to present dai, as her fadris diden.

CAP 18
1 In the thridde yeer of Osee, sone of Hela, kyng of Israel, regnyde Ezechie, sone of Achaz, kyng of Juda.
2 He was of fyue and twenti yeer, whanne he bigan to regne, and he regnyde in Jerusalem nyne and twenti yeer; the name of his modir was Abisa, douyter of Zacharie.
3 And he dide that, that was good bifor the Lord, bi alle thingis, which Dauid, his fadir, hadde do.
4 And he distriede hiye places, and al to-brak ymagis, and kittide doun wodis, and he brak the brasun serpent, whom Moyses hadde maad; for `til to that tyme the sones of Israel brenten encense to it; and he clepide the name therof Noestam.
5 And he hopide in the Lord God of Israel; therfor aftir hym noon was lijk hym of alle the kyngis of Juda, but `and nether in tho kyngis that weren bifor hym.
6 And he cleuyde to the Lord, and yede not awei fro hise steppis, and he dide the comaundementis of the Lord, whiche the Lord comaundide to Moises;
7 wherfor and the Lord was with hym, and he gouernede wiseli hym silf in alle thingis, to whiche he yede forth. Also he rebellide ayens the kyng of Assiriens, and therfor he seruede not to `that kyng of Asseriens;
8 and he smoot Philisteis `til to Gazam, and alle the termes of hem, fro the tour of keperis `til to a citee maad strong.
9 In the fourthe yeer of kyng Ezechie, that was the seuenthe yeer of Osee, sone of Hela, kyng of Israel, Salmanazar, kyng of Assiriens, stiede to Samarie,
10 and fauyt ayens it, and took it. For after thre yeer, in the sixte yeer of Ezechie, that is, in the nynthe yeer of Osee, kyng of Israel, Samarie was takun;
11 and the kyng of Assiriens translatide Israel in to Assiriens, and settyde hem in Haila, and in Habor, ryueris of Gozam, in the citees of Medeis;
12 for thei herden not the vois of her Lord God, but thei braken his couenaunt; thei herden not, nether diden alle thingis, whiche Moises, the seruaunt of the Lord, comaundide.
13 In the fourtenthe yeer of kyng Ezechie, Senacherub, kyng of Assiryens, stiede to alle the strengthide citees of Juda, and took tho.
14 Thanne Ezechie, kyng of Juda, sente messangeris to the kyng of Assiriens in to Lachis, and seide, Y haue synned; go awei fro me, and Y schal bere `al thing, which thou schalt putte to me. Therfor the kyng of Asseriens puttide on Ezechie, kyng of Juda, thre hundrid talentis of siluer, and thretti talentis of gold.
15 And Ezechie yaf al the siluer, that was foundun in the hows of the Lord, and in the kyngis tresories.
16 In that tyme Ezechie brak the yatis of the temple of the Lord, and the platis of gold, whiche he hadde fastned, and he yaf tho to the kyng of Assiriens.
17 Forsothe the kyng of Assiriens sente Thercha and Rabsaces fro Lachis to kyng Ezechie, with strong hond to Jerusalem; and whanne thei hadden stied, thei camen to Jerusalem, and stoden bisidis the water cundijt of the hiyere cisterne, which is in the weie of the fullere, `ethir toukere.
18 And thei clepiden the kyng; sotheli Eliachym, sone of Elchie, the souereyn of the hows, and Sobna, scryueyn, and Joahe, chaunseler, the sone of Asaph, yeden out to hem.
19 And Rabsaces seide to hem, Speke ye to Ezechie, The grete kyng, the kyng of Assiriens, seith these thingis, What is this trist, in which thou enforsist?
20 In hap thou hast take counsel, that thou woldist make thee redi to batel. In whom tristist thou, that thou be hardi to rebelle?
21 Whethir thou hopist in a `staf of rehed and brokun, Egipt, on which, if a man lenith, it schal be brokun, and schal entre in to hys hond, and schal peerse it? So is Farao, kyng of Egipt, to alle men that tristen on hym.
22 That if thou seist to me, We han trist in `oure Lord God; whether this is not he, whos hiye thingis and auteris Ezechie took awei, and comaundide to Juda and to Jerusalem, Ye schulen worschipe bifor this auter in Jerusalem?
23 Now therfor passe ye to my lord, the kyng of Assiriens, and Y schal yyue to you twei thousynde of horsis, and se ye, whether ye moun haue rideris of `tho horsis?
24 And hou moun ye withstonde bifor o prince of the leste seruauntis of my lord? Whether thou hast trist in Egipt, for charis and knyytis?
25 Whether Y stiede with outen `Goddis wille to this place, that Y schulde distrie it? `The Lord seide to me, `Stie thou to this lond, and distrie thou it.
26 Forsothe Eliachym, sone of Elchie, and Sobna, and Joahe, seiden to Rabsaces, We preien, that thou speke bi the langage of Sirie to vs, thi seruauntis; for we vndirstondun this langage; and that thou speke not to vs bi the langage of Juwis, while the puple herith, which is on the wal.
27 And Rabsaces answeride, `and seide, Whethir my lord sente me to thi lord and to thee, that Y schulde speke these wordis, and not rather to the men `that sitten on the wal, that thei ete her toordis, and drynke her pisse with you?
28 Therfor Rabsaces stood, and criede with greet vois bi langage of Jewis, and seide, Here ye the wordis of the greet kyng, the kyng of Assiriens.
29 The kyng seith these thingis, Ezechie disceyue not you, for he may not delyuere you fro myn hond;
30 nether yyue he trist to you on the Lord, and seie, The Lord delyuerynge schal delyuere vs, and this citee shal not be bitakun in the hond of the kyng of Assiriens;
31 nyle ye here Ezechie. For the kyng of Assiriens seith these thingis, Do ye with me that, that is profitable to you, and go ye out to me; and eche man schal ete of his vyner, and of his fige tree, and ye schulen drynke watris of youre cisternes,
32 til Y come, and translate you in to a lond which is lijk youre lond, in to a fruytful lond, and plenteuouse of wyn, a lond of breed, and of vineris, a lond of olyue trees, and of oile, and of hony; and ye schulen lyue, and ye schulen not die. Nyle ye here Ezechie, that disseyueth you, and seith, The Lord schal delyuere yow.
33 Whether the goddis of hethene men delyueriden her lond fro the hond of the kyng of Assiriens?
34 Where is god of Emath, and of Arphat? Where is god of Sapharuaym, of Ana, and of Aua? Whether thei delyueriden Samarie fro myn hond?
35 For who ben thei in alle goddis of londis, that delyueriden her cuntrey fro myn hond, that the Lord may delyuere Jerusalem fro myn hoond?
36 Therfor the puple was stille, and answeride not ony thing to hym; for thei hadden take comaundement of the kyng, that thei schulden not answere to hym.
37 And Eliachym, sone of Elchie, the souereyn of the hows, and Sobna, scryuen, and Joahe, chaunceler, the sone of Asaph, camen with to-rent clothis to Ezechie; and telden to hym the wordis of Rabsaces.

CAP 19
1 And whanne kyng Ezechie hadde herd these thingis, he to-rente his clothis, and was hilid with a sak; and he entride in to the hous of the Lord.
2 And he sente Eliachym, souereyn of the hous, and Sobna, scryueyn, and elde men of the preestis, hilid with sackis, to Ysaie, the prophete, sone of Amos.
3 Whiche seiden, Ezechie seith these thingis, This dai is a dai of tribulacioun, and of blamyng, and of blasfemye; sones camen `til to the childberyng, and the `traueler of childe hath not strengthis.
4 If perauenture thi Lord God here alle the wordis of Rabsaces, whom the kyng of Assiryens, his lord sente, that he schulde dispise the Lord lyuynge, and repreue bi wordis, whiche thi Lord God herde; and make thou preier for these relikis, that ben foundun.
5 Therfor the seruauntis of kyng Ezechie camen to Isaie;
6 and Isaie seide to hem, Seie ye these thingis to youre lord, The Lord seith these thingis, Nyle thou drede of the face of wordis whiche thou herdist, bi whiche the children of the kyng of Assiriens blasfemeden me.
7 Lo! Y schal sende to hym a spirit, and he schal here a messanger, and he schal turne ayen in to his lond; and Y schal caste hym doun bi swerd in his owne lond.
8 Therfor Rabsaces turnede ayen, and foond the kyng of Assiriens fiytynge ayens Lobna; for he hadde herd, that the kyng hadde go awei fro Lachis.
9 And whanne he hadde herd of Theracha, kyng of Ethiope, `men seyynge, Lo! he yede out, that he fiyte ayens thee; that he schulde go ayens `that kyng, he sente messangeris to Ezechie,
10 and seide, Seie ye these thingis to Ezechie, kyng of Juda, Thi Lord God, in whom thou hast trist, disseyue not thee, nether seie thou, Jerusalem schal not be `bitakun in to the hondis of the kyng of Assiriens;
11 for thou thi silf herdist what thingis the kyngis of Assiriens diden in alle londis, hou thei wastiden tho; whether therfor thou aloone maist be delyuered?
12 Whether the goddis of hethene men delyueriden alle men whiche my fadris distrieden, that is, Gozam, and Aran, and Reseph, and the sones of Eden, that weren in Thelassar?
13 Where is the kyng of Emath, and the kyng of Arphat? and the kyng of the cytee of Sepharuaym, of Ana, and of Aua?
14 Therfor whanne Ezechie hadde take the lettris fro the hond of messangeris, and hadde red tho, he stiede in to the hows of the Lord, and spredde abrood tho bifor the Lord;
15 and preiede in his siyt, and seide, Lord God of Israel, that sittist on cherubym, thou art God aloone of alle kyngis of erthe; thou madist heuene and erthe.
16 Bowe thin eere, and here; opyn thin iyen, Lord, and se; and here alle the wordis of Senacherib, which sente, that he schulde dispise `to vs `God lyuynge.
17 Verili, Lord, the kynges of Assiriens distrieden hethene men, and the londis of alle men,
18 and senten the goddis of hem in to fier; for thei weren not goddis, but werkis of `hondis of men, of tre and stoon; and thei losten `tho goddis.
19 Now therfor, oure Lord God, make vs saaf fro the hond of hem, that alle rewmes of erthe wite that thou art the Lord God aloone.
20 Forsothe Isaie, sone of Amos, sente to Ezechie, and seide, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, Y haue herd tho thingis, whiche thou preidist me on Sennacherib, king of Assiriens.
21 This is the word, which the Lord spak of hym, Thou virgyn douytir of Syon, he dispiside thee, and scornyde thee; thou douyter of Jerusalem, he mouyde his heed aftir thi bak.
22 Sennacherib, whom `dispisidist thou, and whom `blasfemedist thou? Ayens whom hast thou reisid thi vois, and hast reisid thin iyen an hiye? Ayens the hooli of Israel.
23 Bi the hond of thi seruauntis thou dispisidist the Lord, and seidist, In the multitude of my charys Y stiede in to the hiye thingis of hillis, in the hiynesse of Liban, and kittide doun the hiye cedris therof, and the chosyn beechis therof; and Y entride `til to the termes therof,
24 and Y kittide doun the forest of Carmele therof; and Y drank alien watris, and Y made drie with the steppis of `the feet of myn `alle watris closid.
25 Whether thou herdist not, what Y made at the bigynnyng? Fro elde daies Y made it, and now Y haue brouyt forth; and strengthid citees of fiyteris schulen be in to fallyng of hillis.
26 And thei that sitten meke of hond in tho, trembliden togidere, and ben schent; thei ben maad as the hei of the feeld, and as grene eerbe of roouys, which is dried, bifor that it cam to ripenesse.
27 And Y bifor knew thi dwellyng, and thi goyng out, and thin entryng, and thi weie, and thi woodnesse ayens me.
28 Thou were wood ayens me, and thi pride stide in to myn eeris; therfor Y schal putte a cercle in thi nosethirlis, and a bernacle in thi lippis, and Y schal lede thee ayen in to the weie bi which thou camest.
29 Forsothe, Ezechie, this schal be a signe `to thee; ete thou in this yeer that, that thou fyndist; forsothe in the secounde yeer tho thingis, that growen bi her owne wille; sotheli in the thridde yeer sowe ye, and repe ye, plaunte ye vyneris, and ete the fruytis of tho.
30 And what euer thing schal be residue of the hows of Juda, it schal sende root dounward, and schal make fruyt vpward.
31 For relikis schulen go out of Jerusalem, and that, that schal be sauyd, `schal go out of the hil of Syon; the feruent loue of the Lord of oostis schal do this.
32 Wherfor the Lord seith these thingis of the kyng of Assiriens, He schal not entre in to this citee, nethir he schal sende an arowe in to it, nether scheeld shal occupie it, nether strengthing, ethir bisegyng, schal cumpasse it.
33 He schal turne ayen bi the weie `bi which he cam, and he schal not entre in to this citee, seith the Lord;
34 and Y schal defende this citee, and Y schal saue it for me, and for Dauid, my seruaunt.
35 Therfor it was don, in that niyt the aungel of the Lord cam, and smoot in the castels of Assiryens an hundrid foure score and fyue thousynde. And whanne Sennacherib hadde rise eerli, he siy alle bodies of deed men; and he departide, and yede awei.
36 And Sennacherib, the kyng of Assiriens, turnede ayen, and dwellide in Nynyue.
37 And whanne he worschipide in the temple Nestrach his god, Adramelech and Sirasar, his sones, killide hym with swerd; and thei fledden in to the lond of Armenyes; and Asaradon, his sone, regnyde for hym.

CAP 20
1 In tho daies Ezechie was sijk `til to the deeth; and Isaie, the prophete, sone of Amos, cam to hym, and seide to hym, The Lord God seith these thingis, Comaunde to thin hows, for thou schalt die, and thou schalt not lyue.
2 Which Ezechie turnyde his face to the wal, and worschipide the Lord,
3 and seide, Y biseche, Lord, haue mynde, hou Y yede bifor thee in treuthe, and in a parfit herte, and Y dide that, that was plesaunt bifor thee. Therfor Ezechie wepte bi greet wepyng.
4 And bifor that Ysaie yede out half the part of the court, the word of the Lord was maad to Isaie, and seide,
5 Turne thou ayen, and seie to Ezechie, duyk of my puple, The Lord God of Dauid, thi fadir, seith thes thingis, Y herde thi preiere, and Y siy thi teer, and, lo! Y heelide thee. In the thridde dai thou schalt stie in to the temple of the Lord,
6 and Y schal adde fiftene yeer to thi daies; but also Y schal delyuere thee and this citee fro the hond of the kyng of Assiriens, and Y schal defende this citee for me, and for Dauid, my seruaunt.
7 And Ysaie seide, Brynge ye to me a gobet of figis. And whanne thei hadden brouyte it, and hadde putte on `his botche, he was heelid.
8 Forsothe Ezechie seide to Isaie, What schal be the signe, that the Lord schal heele me, and that in the thridde dai Y schal stie in to the temple of the Lord?
9 To whom Ysaie seide, This schal be `a signe of the Lord, that the Lord schal do the word which he spak; wolt thou, that the schadewe stie by ten lynes, ethir turne ayen bi so many degrees?
10 And Ezechie seide, It is esy that the schadewe encreesse bi ten lynes, nethir Y wole that this be doon, but that it turne ayen bacward bi ten degrees.
11 Therfor Ysaie, the prophete, clepide inwardli the Lord, and brouyte ayen bacward bi ten degrees the schadewe bi lynes, bi whiche it hadde go doun thanne in the orologie of Achaz.
12 In that tyme Beradacbaladan, sone of Baladam, the kyng of Babiloyne, sente lettris and yiftis to Ezechie; for he hadde herd that Ezechie was sijk, and hadde couerid.
13 Forsothe Ezechie was glad in the comyng of hem, and he schewide to hem the hows of spyceries, and gold, and siluer, and dyuerse pymentis, also oynementis, and the hows of hise vessels, and alle thingis whiche he myyte haue in hise tresouris; `no word was, `which Ezechie schewide not to hem in his hows, and in al his power.
14 Sotheli Ysaie, the prophete, cam to the kyng Ezechie, and seide to hym, What seiden these men, ether fro whennus camen thei to the? To whom Ezechie seide, Thei camen to me fro a fer lond, fro Babiloyne.
15 And he answeride, What `sien thei in thin hows? Ezechie seide, Thei sien alle thingis, what euer thingis ben in myn hows; no thing is in my tresouris, which Y schewide not to hem.
16 Therfor Isaie seide to Ezechie, Here thou the word of the Lord.
17 Lo! dayes comen, and alle thingis that ben in thin hows, and `whiche thingis thi fadris maden til in to this dai, schulen be takun awey into Babiloyne; `not ony thing schal dwelle, seith the Lord.
18 But also of thi sones, that schulen go out of thee, whiche thou schalt gendere, schulen be takun, and thei schulen be geldyngis in the paleis of the king of Babiloyne.
19 Ezechie seide to Isaie, The word of the Lord, `which he spak, is good; ooneli pees and treuthe be in my daies.
20 Forsothe the residue of wordis of Ezechie, and al his strengthe, and hou he made a cisterne, and a watir cundijt, and brouyte watris, `in to the citee, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Juda?

CAP 21
21 And Ezechie slepte with hise fadris, and Manasses, his sone, regnyde for hym.
1 Manasses was of twelue yeer, whanne he bigan to regne, and he regnyde fyue and fifti yeer in Jerusalem; the name of his modir was Asiba.
2 And he dide yuel in the siyt of the Lord, bi the idols of hethene men, whiche hethene men the Lord dide awei fro the face of the sones of Israel.
3 And he was turned, and bildide hiye thingis, whiche Ezechie, his fadir, distriede; and he reiside auteris of Baal, and he made woodis, as Achab kyng of Israel hadde do; and he worschipide `with out forth al the knyythod of heuene, and worschipide it in herte.
4 And he bildide auteris in the hows of the Lord, of which the Lord seide, Y schal sette my name in Jerusalem.
5 And he bildide auteris to al the knyythod of heuene in the twei large places of the temple of the Lord;
6 and he `ledde ouer his sone thorouy the fier; and he vside false dyuynyngis in auteris, on whiche sacrifice was maad to feendis, and he kepte false dyuynyngis bi chiteryng of bryddis; and he made men to haue yuele spiritis spekynge in the wombe, and he multipliede false dyuynours in entraylis of beestis sacrified to feendis, that he schulde do yuel bifor the Lord, and terre hym to ire.
7 And he settide an ydol of wode, which he hadde maad, in the temple of the Lord, `of which temple the Lord spak to Dauid, and to Salomon, his sone, Y schal sette my name withouten ende in this temple, and in Jerusalem which Y chees of alle the lynagis of Israel.
8 And Y schal nomore make the foot of Israel to be moued fro the lond which Y yaf to the fadris of hem; so netheles if thei kepen in werk alle thingis whiche Y comaundide to hem, and al the lawe whiche Moises, my seruaunt, comaundide to hem.
9 Sotheli thei herden not, but weren disseyued of Manasses, that thei diden yuel ouer hethene men, whiche the Lord al to-brak fro the face of the sones of Israel.
10 And the Lord spak in the hond of his seruauntis prophetis, and seide,
11 For Manasses, kyng of Juda, dide these worste abhomynaciouns ouer alle thingis which Ammorreis diden bifor hym, and maden also the puple of Juda to do synne in hise vnclennessis;
12 therfor the Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, Lo! Y schal brynge in yuelis on Jerusalem and Juda, that who euer herith, bothe hise eeris tyngle;
13 and Y schal holde forth on Jerusalem the corde of Samarie, and the birthun of the hows of Achab, and Y schal do awei Jerusalem, as tablis ben wont to be doon awei; and Y schal do awey and turne it, and Y schal lede ful ofte the poyntel on the face therof.
14 Forsothe Y schal leeue relikis of myn eritage, and Y schal bitake hem in to the hond of enemyes therof; and thei schulen be in distriynge, and in raueyn to alle her aduersaries;
15 for thei diden yuel bifor me, and thei continueden terrynge me to ire, fro the dai in which her fadris yeden out of the lond of Egipt `til to this day.
16 Ferthermore also Manasses schedde ful myche ynnocent blood, til he fillide Jerusalem `til to the mouth, with outen hise synnes bi whiche he made Juda to do synne, to do yuel bifor the Lord.
17 Forsothe the residue of the wordis of Manasses, and alle thingis whiche he dide, and his synne whiche he synnede, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Juda?
18 And Manasses slepte with hise fadris, and was biried in the gardyn of his hows, in the gardyn of Azam; and Amon, his sone, regnyde for hym.
19 He was of two and twenti yeer, whanne he bigan to regne; and he regnede twei yeer in Jerusalem; the name of his modir was Mesalamech, the douyter of Arus of Gethela.
20 And he dide yuel in the siyt of the Lord, as Manasses, his fader, hadde do.
21 And he yede in al the weie, bi which his fader hadde go, and he seruide to vnclennessis, to whiche his fadir hadde seruyd, and he worschipide tho; and he forsook the Lord God of hise fadris,
22 and he yede not in the weye of the Lord.
23 And hise seruauntis settiden tresouns to hym, and killiden the kyng in hise hows.
24 Sothely the puple of the Lord smoot alle men, that hadden conspirid ayens kyng Amon, and thei ordeyneden to hem a kyng, Josias, `his sone, for hym.
25 Forsothe the residue of wordis of Amon, whiche he dide, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Juda?
26 And he slepte with hise fadris, and thei birieden hym in his sepulcre in the gardyn of Azam; and Josias, his sone, regnede for him.

CAP 22
1 Josias was of eiyte yeer, whanne he bigan to regne, and he regnyde oon and thritti yeer in Jerusalem; the name of his modir was Ydida, the douytir of Phadaia of Besechath.
2 And he dide that, that was plesaunt bifor the Lord, and he yede be alle the wayes of Dauid, his fadir; he bowide not, nethir to the riytside, nethir of the leftside.
3 Forsothe in the eiytenthe yeer of kyng Josias, the kyng sente Saphan, sone of Asua, the sone of Mesulam, scryueyn, ethir doctour, of the temple of the Lord,
4 and seide to him, Go thou to Elchie, the grete preest, that the money, which is borun in to the temple of the Lord, be spendid, which money the porteris of the temple han gaderid of the puple;
5 and that it be youun to crafti men bi the souereyns of the hows of the Lord; which also departide that money to hem that worchen in the temple of the Lord, to reparele the rooues of the temple of the Lord,
6 that is, to carpenteris, and to masouns, and to hem that maken brokun thingis, and that trees and stoonus of quarieris be bouyt, to reparele the temple of the Lord;
7 netheles siluer, which thei taken, be not rekynyd to hem, but haue thei in power, and in feith.
8 Forsothe Helchie, the bischop, seide to Saphan, the scryuen, Y haue founde the book of the lawe in the hows of the Lord. And Elchie yaf the book to Saphan, the scryuen, which also redde it.
9 Also Saphan, the scryuen, cam to the kyng, and telde to hym tho thingis, whiche Elchie hadde comaundid, and he seide, Thi seruauntis han spendid the monei, which was foundun in the hows of the Lord, and yauen, that it schulde be departid to crafti men of the souereyns of werkis of the temple of the Lord.
10 Also Saphan, the scriueyn, telde to the kyng, and seide, Helchie, the preest of God, yaf to me a book; and whanne Saphan hadde red that book bifor the kyng,
11 and the kyng hadde herd the wordis of the book of the lawe of the Lord, he to-rente hise clothis.
12 And he comaundide to Elchie, the preest, and to Aicham, sone of Saphan, and to Achabor, sone of Mycha, and to Saphan, the scryuen, and to Achia, seruaunt of the kyng,
13 and seide, Go ye, and `counsele ye the Lord on me, and on the puple, and on al Juda, of the wordis of this book, which is foundun; for greet ire of the Lord is kyndlid ayens vs, for oure fadris herden not the wordis of this book, to do al thing which is writun to vs.
14 Therfor Helchie, the preest, and Aicham, and Achabor, and Saphan, and Asia, yeden to Olda, the prophetesse, the wijf of Sellum, sone of Thecue, sone of Aras, kepere of the clothis, which Olda dwellide in Jerusalem, in the secounde dwellyng; and thei spaken to hir.
15 And sche answeride to hem, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, Seie ye to the man,
16 that sente you to me, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, Lo! Y schal brynge yuelis on this place, and on the dwelleris therof, alle the wordis `of the lawe, whiche the kyng of Juda redde;
17 for thei forsoken me, and maden sacrifice to alien goddis, and terriden me to ire in alle the werkis of her hondis; and myn indignacioun schal be kyndlid in this place, and schal not be quenchid.
18 Sotheli to the kyng of Juda, that sente you, that ye schulen `counsele the Lord, ye schulen seie thus, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, For thou herdist the wordis of the book,
19 and thin herte was aferd, and thou were maad meke bifor the Lord, whanne the wordis weren herd ayens this place and ayens the dwelleris therof, that is, that thei schulden be maad in to wondryng, and in to cursyng, and thou to-rentist thi clothis, and weptist bifor me, and Y herde, seith the Lord;

CAP 23
1 And thei telden to the kyng that, that sche seide; `which kyng sente, and alle the elde men of Juda, and of Jerusalem, weren gaderid to hym.
2 And the kyng stiede in to the temple of the Lord, and alle the men of Juda, and alle men that dwelliden in Jerusalem with hym, the preestis, and the prophetis, and al the puple, fro litil `til to greet; and he redde, while alle men herden, alle the wordis of the book of boond of pees of the Lord, which book was foundun in the hows of the Lord.
3 And the kyng stood on the grees; and he smoot boond of pees bifor the Lord, that thei schulden go aftir the Lord, and kepe hise comaundementis and witnessyngis and cerymonyes in al the herte and in al the soule, that thei schulden reise the wordis of this boond of pees, that weren writun in that book; and the puple assentide to the couenaunt.
4 And the kyng comaundide to Helchie, the bischop, and to the preestis of the secounde ordre, and to the porteris, that thei schulden caste out of the temple alle the vesselis, that weren maad to Baal, and in the wode, and to al the knyythod of heuene; and he brente tho vessels with out Jerusalem, in the euene valey of Cedron, and he bar the poudir of tho `vessels in to Bethel.
5 And he dide awei false dyuynours `that dyuynyden in the entrailis of beestis sacrified to idols, whiche the kingis of Juda hadden sett to make sacrifice in hiy thingis bi the citees of Juda, and in the cumpas of Jerusalem; and he dide awey hem that brenten encense to Baal, and to the sunne, and to the moone, and to twelue signes, and to al the knyythod of heuene.
6 And he made the wode to be borun out of the hows of the Lord without Jerusalem in the euene valey of Cedron, and he brente it there; and he droof it in to poudir, and castide it forth on the sepulcris of the comyn puple.
7 Also he distriede the litle housis of `men turnyd into wommens condiciouns, whiche housis weren in the hows of the Lord; for whiche the wymmen `maden as litil howsis of the wode.
8 And he gaderide alle the preestis fro the citees of Juda, and he defoulide the hiye thingis, where the preestis maden sacrifice, fro Gabaa `til to Bersabee; and he distriede the auters of yatis in the entryng of the dore of Josie, prince of a citee, which dore was at the lift half of the yate of the cytee.
9 Netheles the preestis of hiye thingis stieden not to the auter of the Lord in Jerusalem, but oneli thei eten therf looues in the myddis of her britheren.
10 Also he defoulide Tophet, which is in the euene valey of the sone of Ennon, that no man schulde halewe his sone ether his douytir bi fier to Moloch.
11 Also he dide awei horsis, whiche the kyngis of Juda hadden youe to the sunne, in the entryng of the temple of the Lord, bisidis the chaumbir of Nathanmalech, geldyng, that was in Pharurym; forsothe he brente bi fier the charis of the sunne.
12 Also the kyng distriede the auteris, that weren on the roouys of the soler of Achaz, whiche auteris the kyngis of Juda hadden maad; and the kyng distriede the auteris, whiche Manasses hadde maad in the twei grete placis of the temple of the Lord; and he ran fro thennus, and scateride the askis of tho in to the strond of Cedron.
13 Also the kyng defoulide the hiye thingis, that weren in Jerusalem at the riyt part of the hil of offencioun, whiche Salomon, kyng of Israel, hadde bildid to Astroth, the ydol of Sidoneis, and to Chamos, the offencioun of Moab, and to Melchon, abhominacioun of the sones of Amon;
14 and he al to-brak ymagis, and kittide doun wodis, and fillide the places of tho with the boonys of deed men.
15 Ferthermore also he distriede the auter that was in Bethel, and `he distriede the hiye thing, which Jeroboam, sone of Nabath, hadde maad, that made Israel to do synne; and he distriede that hiy autir, and brente it, and al to brak it in to poudir, and kittide doun also the wode.
16 And Josias turnyde, and siy there sepulcris that weren in the hil; and he sente, and took the boonys fro the sepulcris, and brente tho on the auter, and defoulide it bi the word of the Lord, which word the man of God spak, that biforseide these wordis.
17 And the kyng seide, What is this biriel, which Y se? And the citeseyns of that citee answeriden to hym, It is the sepulcre of the man of God, that cam fro Juda, and biforseide these wordis, whiche thou hast doon on the auter of Bethel.
18 And the kyng seide, Suffre ye hym; no man moue hise boonys. And hise boonys dwelliden vntouchid with the boones of the prophete, that cam fro Samarie.
19 Ferthermore also Josias dide awei alle the templis of hiye thingis, that weren in the citees of Samarie, whiche the kyngis of Israel hadden maad to terre the Lord to ire; and he dide to tho templis bi alle thingis whiche he hadde do in Bethel.
20 And he killide alle the preestis of hiye thingis, that weren there on the auteris, and he brente mennus boonus on tho auteris; and he turnede ayen to Jerusalem;
21 and comaundide to al the puple, and seide, Make ye pask to `youre Lord God, vp that, that is writun in the book of this boond of pees.
22 Forsothe sich pask was not maad, fro the daies of iugis that demyden Israel, and of alle daies of the kyngis of Israel and of Juda,
23 as this pask was maad to the Lord in Jerusalem in the eiytenthe yeer of kyng Josias.
24 But also Josias dide awei men hauynge fendis spekinge in her wombis, and false diuinouris in auteris, and `he dide awei the figuris of idols, and alle vnclennessis, and abhomynaciouns, that weren in the lond of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he schulde do the wordis of the lawe, that weren writun in the book, `which book Elchie, the preest, foond in the temple of the Lord.
25 No kyng bifor him was lijk hym, `that turnede ayen to the Lord in al his herte, and in al his soule, and in al his vertu, bi al the lawe of Moises; nether aftir hym roos ony lijk hym.
26 Netheles the Lord was not turned awei fro the ire of his greet veniaunce, bi which his strong veniaunce was wrooth ayens Juda, for the terryngis to ire by whiche Manasses hadde terrid hym to ire.
27 Therfor the Lord seide, Y schal do awei also Juda fro my face, as Y dide awei Israel; and Y schal caste awei this citee, which Y chees, Jerusalem, and the hows `of which Y seide, My name schal be there.
28 Forsothe the residue of wordis of Josias, and alle thingis whiche he dide, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Juda?
29 In the daies of hym Farao Nechao, kyng of Egipt, stiede ayens the kyng of Assiriens, to the flood Eufrates; and Josias, kyng of Juda, yede in to metyng of hym, and Josias was slayn in Magedo, whanne he hadde seyn hym.
30 And `hise seruauntis baren hym deed fro Magedo, and brouyte him in to Jerusalem, and birieden hym in his sepulcre; and the puple of the lond took Joachaz, sone of Josias, and anoyntiden hym, and maden hym kyng for his fadir.

32 And he dide yuel bifor the Lord, bi alle thingis which hise fadris hadden do.
33 And Farao Nechao boond hym in Reblatha, which is in the lond of Emath, that he schulde not regne in Jerusalem; and he settide `peyne, ether raunsum, to the lond, in an hundrid talentis of siluer, and in a talent of gold.
34 And Farao Nechao made kyng Eliachim, sone of Josias, for Josias, his fadir; and he turnede the name of hym Joachym; forsothe Farao took Joachaz, and ledde hym in to Egipt.
35 Sotheli Joachym yaf siluer and gold to Farao, whanne he hadde comaundid to the lond bi alle yeeris, that it schulde be brouyt, bi the comaundement of Farao; and he reiside of ech man bi hise myytis bothe siluer and gold, of the puple of the lond, that he schulde yyue to Pharao Nechao.
