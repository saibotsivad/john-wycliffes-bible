2 And Nathan seide to Dauid, Do thou alle thingis that ben in thin herte, for God is with thee.
3 Therfor in that nyyt the word of the Lord was maad to Nathan,
4 and seide, Go thou, and speke to Dauid, my seruaunt, The Lord seith these thingis, Thou schalt not bilde to me an hows to dwelle in;
5 for Y `dwellide not in an hows, fro that tyme in which Y ledde Israel out of the lond of Egipt til to this dai, but euere Y chaungide places of tabernacle, and dwellide in a tente with al Israel.
6 Where I spak nameli to oon of the iugis of Israel, to which I comaundide that thei schulde fede my puple, and seide, Whi `bildidist thou not to me an hous of cedre?
7 Now therfor thou schalt speke thus to my seruaunt Dauid, The Lord of oostis seith these thingis, Y took thee, whanne thou suedist the floc in the lesewis, that thou schuldist be duyk on my puple Israel;
8 and Y was with thee whidur euere thou yedist, and Y killide alle thin enemyes bifor thee, and Y made to thee an name as of oon of the grete men that ben maad worschipful, ether `famouse, in erthe.
9 And Y yaf a place to my puple Israel; it schal be plauntid, and schal dwelle there ynne, and it schal no more be moued, and the sones of wickydnesse schulen not defoule hem,
10 as fro the bigynnyng, fro the daies in whiche Y yaf iugis to my puple Israel; and Y made lowe alle thin enemyes. Therfor Y telle to thee, that the Lord schal bilde an hows to thee.
11 And whanne thou hast fillid thi daies, that thou go to thi fadris, Y schal reise thi seed after thee, that schal be of thi sones, and Y schal stablische his rewme;
12 he schal bilde to me an hows, and Y schal make stidefast his seete til in to with outen ende.
13 Y schal be to hym in to a fadir, and he schal be to me in to a sone; and Y schal not do my mersi fro hym, as Y took awei fro hym that was bifore thee;
14 and Y schal ordeyne hym in myn hows and in my rewme til in to with outen ende; and his trone schal be moost stidefast with outen ende.
15 Bi alle these wordis, and bi al this reuelacioun, so Nathan spak to Dauid.
16 And whanne kyng Dauid hadde come, and hadde sete bifore the Lord, he seide, Lord God, who am Y, and what is myn hows, that thou schuldist yyue siche thingis to me?

3 In that tyme Dauid smoot also Adadezer, kyng of Soba, of the cuntrey of Emath, whanne he yede for to alarge his empire til to the flood Eufrates.
4 Therfor Dauid took a thousynde foure horsid cartis of his, and seuene thousynde of horsmen, and twenti thousynde of foot men; and he hoxide alle the horsis of charis, outakun an hundrid foure horsid cartis, whiche he kepte to hym silf.

9 And whanne Thou, kyng of Emath, hadde herd this thing, `that is, that Dauid hadde smyte al the oost of Adadezer, kyng of Soba,
10 he sente Aduram, his sone, to Dauid the kyng, for to axe of hym pees, and for to thanke hym, for he hadde ouercome and hadde smyte Adadezer; for whi king Adadezer was aduersarie of Thou.
11 But also kyng Dauid halewide to the Lord alle the vessels of gold, and of siluer, and of bras; and the siluer, and the gold, which the kyng hadde take of alle folkis, as wel of Idumee and Moab, and of the sones of Amon, as of Filisteis and Amalech.

13 And he settide strong hold in Edom, that Ydumei schulde serue Dauid. And the Lord sauide Dauid in alle thingis, to whiche he yede.
14 Therfor Dauid regnede on al Israel, and dide doom and riytwisnesse to al his puple.

1 Forsothe it bifelde, that Naas, kyng of the sones of Amon, diede, and his sone regnyde for him.
2 And Dauid seide, Y schal do mercy with Anoon, the sone of Naas; for his fadir yaf merci to me. And Dauid sente messageris, to coumforte hym on the deeth of his fadir. And whanne thei weren comen in to the lond of the sones of Amon,

4 Therfor Anoon made ballid and schauyde the children of Dauid, and kittide the cootis of hem fro the buttokis of hem til to the feet; and lefte hem.
5 And whanne thei hadden go, and hadden sent this to Dauid, he sente in to the meting of hem; for thei hadden suffrid greet dispit; and he comaundide, that thei schulden dwelle in Gerico, til her berde wexide, and thanne thei schulden turne ayen.

8 And whanne Dauid `hadde herd this, he sente Joab, and al the oost of stronge men.
9 And the sones of Amon yeden out, and dressiden scheltrun bisidis the yate of the citee; but the kyngis, that weren comen to helpe, stoden asidis half in the feeld.
10 Therfor Joab vndurstood, that batel was maad ayens hym `euene ayens and bihynde the bak, and he chees the strongeste men of al Israel, and yede ayens Sirus;
11 sotheli he yaf the residue part of the puple vnder the hond of Abisai, his brother; and thei yeden ayens the sones of Amon.
12 And Joab seide, If Sirus schal ouercome me, thou schalt helpe me; sotheli if the sones of Amon schulen ouercome thee, Y schal helpe thee; be thou coumfortid,
13 and do we manli for oure puple, and for the citees of oure God; forsothe the Lord do that, that is good in his siyt.
14 Therfor Joab yede, and the puple that was with hym, ayens Sirus to batel, and he droof hem awei.
15 Sotheli the sones of Amon sien, that Sirus hadde fled, and thei fledden fro Abisay, his brother, and entriden in to the citee; and Joab turnede ayen in to Jerusalem.

18 `Forsothe Sirus fledde fro Israel, and Dauid killide of men of Sirie seuene thousynde of charis, and fourti thousynde of foot men, and Sophath, the prince of the oost.
19 Sotheli the seruauntis of Adadezer siyen, that thei weren ouercomun of Israel, and thei fledden ouer to Dauid, and seruiden hym; and Sirie wolde no more yyue helpe to the sones of Amon.

1 Forsothe it was doon after the ende of a yeer, in that tyme wherinne kyngis ben wont to go forth to batels, Joab gederide the oost, and the strengthe of chyualrie, and he wastide the lond of the sones of Amon, and yede, and bisegide Rabath; forsothe Dauid dwellide in Jerusalem, whanne Joab smoot Rabath, and distriede it.
2 Forsothe Dauid took the coroun of Melchon fro his heed, and foond therynne the weiyt of gold a talent, and moost precious iemmes, and he made therof a diademe to hym silf; also he took ful many spuylis of the citee.
3 Sotheli he ledde out the puple that was therynne, and made breris, `ethir instrumentis bi whiche cornes ben brokun, and sleddis, and irone charis, to passe on hem, so that alle men weren kit in to dyuerse partis, and weren al to-brokun; Dauid dide thus to alle the `cytees of the sones of Amon, and turnede ayen with al his puple in to Jerusalem.
4 Aftir these thingis a batel was maad in Gazer ayens Filisteis, wherynne Sobochai Vsachites slow Saphai of the kyn of Raphym, and mekide hem.

CAP 21
1 Sotheli Sathan roos ayens Israel, and stiride Dauid for to noumbre Israel.
2 And Dauid seide to Joab, and to the princes of the puple, Go ye, and noumbre Israel fro Bersabe til to Dan, and brynge ye the noumbre to me, that Y wite.
3 And Joab answeride, The Lord encresse his puple an hundrid fold more than thei ben; my lord the kyng, whether alle ben not thi seruauntis? Whi sekith my lord this thing, that schal be arettid in to synne to Israel?
4 But the word of the kyng hadde more the maistrie; and Joab yede out, and cumpasside al Israel, and turnede ayen in to Jerusalem.
5 And he yaf to Dauid the noumbre of hem, which he hadde cumpassid; and al the noumbre of Israel was foundun a thousynde thousande, and an hundrid thousynde of men, drawynge out swerd; forsothe of Juda weren thre hundrid thousynde, and seuenti thousynde of werriouris.
6 For Joab noumbride not Leuy and Beniamyn, for ayens his wille he dide the comaundement of the kyng.
7 Forsothe that that was comaundid displeside the Lord, and he smoot Israel.
8 And Dauid seide to God, Y synnede greetli that Y wolde do this; Y biseche, do thou awey the wickidnesse of thi seruaunt, for Y dide folili.
9 And the Lord spak to Gad, the profete of Dauid,
10 and seide, Go thou, and speke to Dauid, and seie to him, The Lord seith these thingis, Y yeue to thee the chesyng of thre thingis; chese thou oon which thou wolt, that Y do to thee.
11 And whanne Gad was comen to Dauid, he seide to Dauid, The Lord seith these thingis, Chese thou that that thou wolt, ether pestilence thre yeer,
12 ether that thre monethis thou fle thin enemyes and mow not ascape her swerd, ether that the swerd of the Lord and deeth regne thre daies in the lond, and that the aungel of the Lord slee in alle the coostis of Israel. Now therfor se thou, what Y schal answere to hym that sente me.
13 And Dauid seide to Gad, Angwischis oppresse me on ech part, but it is betere to me, that Y falle in to the hondis of the Lord, for his merciful doynges ben manye, than in to the hondis of men.
14 Therfor the Lord sente pestilence in to Israel, and seuenti thousynde of men felden doun of Israel.
15 Also he sente an aungel in to Jerusalem, that he schulde smyte it; and whanne it was smytun, the Lord siy, and hadde merci on the greetnesse of yuel; and comaundide to the aungel that smoot, It suffisith, now thin hond ceesse. Forsothe the aungel of the Lord stood bisidis the cornfloor of Ornam Jebusey.
16 And Dauid reiside hise iyen, and siy the aungel of the Lord stondynge bitwixe heuene and erthe, and a drawun swerd in his hond, and turnede ayens Jerusalem. And bothe he and the grettere men in birthe weren clothid with heiris, and felden doun lowe on the erthe.
17 And Dauid seide to the Lord, Whether Y am not that comaundide that the puple schulde be noumbrid? Y it am that synnede, Y it am that dide yuel; what disseruid this floc? My Lord God, Y biseche, thin hond be turned `in to me, and `in to the hows of my fadir; but thi puple be not smytun.
18 Forsothe an aungel of the Lord comaundide Gad, that he schulde seie to Dauid, `that he schulde stie, and bilde an auter to the Lord God in the cornfloor of Ornam Jebusei.
19 Therfor Dauid stiede bi the word of Gad, which he spak to hym bi the word of the Lord.
20 Forsothe whanne Ornam hadde `biholde, and hadde seyn the aungel, and hise foure sones `with hym `hadde seyn, thei hidden hem, for in that tyme he threischide whete in the cornfloor.
21 Therfor whanne Dauid cam to Ornam, Ornam bihelde Dauid, and yede forth fro the cornfloor ayens hym, and worschipide hym, lowli on the ground.
22 And Dauid seide to hym, Yyue the place of thi cornfloor to me, that Y bilde ther ynne an auter to the Lord; so that thou take as myche siluer as it is worth, and that the veniaunce ceesse fro the puple.
23 Forsothe Ornam seide to Dauid, Take thou, and my lord the kyng do what euer thing plesith hym; but also Y yyue oxis in to brent sacrifice, and instrumentis of tree, wherbi cornes ben throischun, in to trees, and wheete in to sacrifice; Y yyue alle thingis wilfully.
24 And `Dauid the kyng seide to hym, It schal not be don so, but Y schal yyue siluer as myche as it is worth; for Y owe not take awei fro thee, and offre so to the Lord brent sacrifices freli youun.
25 Therfor Dauid yaf to Ornam for the place sixe hundrid siclis of gold of most iust weiyte.
26 And he bildide there an auter to the Lord, and he offride brent sacrifice and pesible sacrifices, and he inwardli clepide God; and God herde hym in fier fro heuene on the auter of brent sacrifice.
27 And the Lord comaundide to the aungel, and he turnede his swerd in to the schethe.
28 Therfor anoon Dauid siy, that the Lord hadde herd hym in the corn floor of Ornam Jebusey, and he offride there slayn sacrifices.
29 Forsothe the tabernacle of the Lord, that Moyses hadde maad in the deseert, and the auter of brent sacrifices, was in that tempest in the hiy place of Gabaon;
30 and Dauid myyte not go to the auter, to biseche God there, for he was aferd bi ful greet drede, seynge the swerd of the `aungel of the Lord.

CAP 22
1 And Dauid seide, This is the hows of God, and this auter is in to brent sacrifice of Israel.

6 And he clepide Salomon, his sone, and comaundide to hym, that he schulde bilde an hows to the Lord God of Israel.
7 And Dauid seide to Salomon, My sone, it was my wille to bilde an hows to the name of `my Lord God;
8 but the word of the Lord was made to me, and seide, Thou hast sched out myche blood, and thou hast fouyt ful many batels; thou mayst not bilde an hows to my name, for thou hast sched out so myche blood bifor me;
9 the sone that schal be borun to thee, schal be a man most pesible, for Y schal make hym to haue reste of alle hise enemyes bi cumpas, and for this cause he schal be clepid pesible, and Y schal yyue pees and reste in Israel in alle hise daies.
10 He schal bilde an hows to my name; he schal be to me in to a sone, and Y schal be to hym in to a fadir, and Y schal make stidefast the seete of his rewme on Israel withouten ende.
11 Now therfor, my sone, the Lord be with thee, and haue thou prosperite, and bilde thou an hows to `thi Lord God, as he spak of thee.
12 And the Lord yyue to thee prudence and wit, that thou mow gouerne Israel, and kepe the lawe of `thi Lord God.
13 For thanne thou maist profite, if thou kepist the comaundementis and domes, whiche the Lord comaundide to Moises, that he schulde teche Israel; be thou coumfortid, and do manli, drede thou not `with outforth, nether drede thou `with ynne.
14 Lo! in my pouert Y haue maad redi the costis of the hows of the Lord; an hundrid thousinde talentis of gold, and a thousynde thousynde talentis of siluer; sotheli of bras and irun is no weiyte, for the noumbre is ouercomun bi greetnesse; Y haue maad redi trees and stoonys to alle costis.
15 Also thou hast ful many crafti men, masouns, and leggeris of stonys, and crafti men of trees, and of alle craftis,

17 Also Dauid comaundide to alle the princis of Israel, that thei schulden helpe Salomon,
18 his sone, and seide, Ye seen, that `youre Lord God is with you, and hath youe to you reste `by cumpas, and hath bitake alle enemyes in youre hoond, and the erthe is suget bifor the Lord, and bifor his puple.
19 Therfor yyue youre hertis and youre soulis, that ye seke `youre Lord God; and rise ye togidere, and bilde ye a seyntuarie to `youre Lord God, that the arke of boond of pees of the Lord be brouyt in, and that vessels halewid to the Lord be brouyt in to the hows, which is bildid to the name of the Lord.
