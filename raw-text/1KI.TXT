1 And kyng Dauid wax eld, and hadde ful many daies of age; and whanne he was hilid with clothis, he was not maad hoot.
2 Therfor hise seruauntis seiden to hym, Seke we to oure lord the kyng a yong wexynge virgyn; and stonde sche bifor the kyng, and nursche sche hym, and slepe in his bosum, and make hoot oure lord the kyng.
3 Therfor thei souyten a yong wexyng virgyn, fair in alle the coostis of Israel; and thei founden Abisag of Sunam, and thei brouyten hir to the kyng.
4 Forsothe the damysel was ful fair, and sche slepte with the kyng, and mynystride to hym; forsothe the king knew not hir fleischli.
5 Sotheli Adonye, sone of Agith, was reisid, and seide, Y schal regne. And he made to hym a chare, and knyytis, and fifti men, that runnen bifor hym.
6 Nether his fadir repreuyde hym ony tyme, and seide, Whi `didist thou this? Forsothe also he was ful fair, the secounde child aftir Absolon; and his word was with Joab,
7 sone of Saruye, and with `Abiathar, preest, that helpiden the partis of Adonye.
8 Sotheli Sadoch, the preest, and Banaie, sone of Joiada, and Nathan, the prophete, and Semey, and Cerethi, and Ferethi, and al the strengthe of the oost of Dauid, weren not with Adonye.
9 Therfor whanne rammes weren offrid, and caluys, and alle fatte thingis, bisidis the stoon Zoelech, that was nyy the welle of Rogel, Adonye clepide alle hise britheren, sones of the kyng, and alle the men of Juda, seruauntis of the kyng.
10 Sotheli `he clepide not Nathan, the profete, and Banaie, and alle stronge men, and Salomon, his brothir.
11 Therfor Nathan seide to Bersabee, modir of Salomon, Whether thou herdist, that Adonye, sone of Agith, regnede, and oure lord Dauid knoweth not this?
12 Now therfor come thou, take thou counsel of me, and saue thi lijf, and of Salomon thi sone.
13 Go thou, and entre to kyng Dauid, and seie thou to hym, Whether not thou, my lord the kyng, hast swore to me, thin handmaide, and seidist, that Salomon thi sone schal regne aftir me, and he schal sitte in my trone?
14 Whi therfor regneth Adonye? And yit while thou schalt speke there with the kyng, Y schal come aftir thee, and `Y schal fille thi wordis.
15 Therfor Bersabee entride to the kyng in the closet; forsothe the kyng was ful eeld, and Abisag of Sunam `mynystride to hym.
16 Bersabee bowide hir silf, and worschipide the kyng; to whom the kyng seide, What wolt thou to thee?
17 And sche answeride, and seide, My lord the kyng, thou hast swore to thin handmaide bi thi Lord God, Salomon thy sone schal regne aftir me, and he schal sitte in my trone;
18 and lo! Adonye hath regnede now, `while thou, my lord the kyng, knowist not;
19 he hath slayn oxis, and alle fatte thingis, and ful many rammes; and he clepide alle the sones of the king, also `Abiathar preest, and Joab, the prince of chyualri; but he clepide not Salomon, thi seruaunt.
20 Netheles, my lord the kyng, the iyen of al Israel biholden in to thee, that thou schewe to hem, who owith to sitte in thi trone, my lord the kyng, aftir thee;
21 and it schal be, whanne my lord the kyng hath slepte with hise fadris, Y and my sone Salomon schulen be synneris.
22 `While sche spak yit with the king, Nathan, the prophete, cam.
23 And thei telden to the kyng, and seiden, Nathan, the prophete, is present. And whanne he hadde entrid in the siyt of the kyng, and hadde worschipide hym lowli to erthe,
24 Nathan seide, My lord the kyng, seidist thou, Adonye regne aftir me, and sitte he on my trone?
25 For he cam doun to dai, and offride oxis, and fatte thingis, and ful many wetheris; and he clepide alle the sones of the kyng, also Abiathar, preest; and whanne thei eten, and drunken bifor hym, and seiden, Kyng Adonye lyue;
26 he clepide not me, thi seruaunt, and Sadoch, preest, and Banaie, sone of Joiada, and Salomon, thi sone.
27 Whether this word yede out fro my lord the kyng, and thou schewidist not to me, thi seruaunt, who schulde sitte on the trone of my lord the king after hym?
28 And kyng Dauid answeride, and seide, Clepe ye Bersabee to me. And whanne sche hadde entrid bifor the kyng, and hadde stonde bifor hym, the kyng swoor,
29 and seide, The Lord lyueth, that delyueryde my lijf fro al angwisch;
30 for as Y swore to thee bi the Lord God of Israel, and seide, Salomon, thi sone, schal regne after me, and he schal sitte on my trone for me, so Y schal do to dai.
31 And Bersabee, with the cheer cast doun in to erthe, worschipide the kyng, and seide, My lord the kyng Dauid lyue with outen ende.
32 And kyng Dauid seide, Clepe ye Sadoch, the preest, to me, and Nathan, the prophete, and Banaie, sone of Joiada. And whanne thei hadden entrid bifor the kyng,
33 the kyng seide to hem, Take with you the seruauntis of youre lord, and putte ye my sone Salomon on my mule, and lede ye hym in to Gyon.
34 And Sadoch, the preest, and Nathan, the profete, anoynte hym in to kyng on Israel and Juda; and ye schulen synge with a clarioun, and ye schulen seie, Lyue kyng Salomon!
35 Ye schulen stie aftir hym, and ye schulen come to Jerusalem; and he schal sitte on my trone, and he schal regne for me; and Y schal comaunde to hym, that he be duyk on Israel and on Juda.
36 And Banaie, sone of Joiada, answeride to the kyng, and seide, Amen, `that is, so be it, ether verili, ether feithfuli; so speke the Lord God of my lord the kyng.
37 As the Lord was with my lord the kyng, so be he with Salomon, and make he the trone of Salomon heiyere than the trone of my lord the kyng Dauid.
38 Therfor Sadoch, the preest, yede doun, and Nathan, the prophete, and Banaie, sone of Joiada, and Cerethi, and Ferethi; and thei puttiden Salomon on the mule of Dauid, the kyng, and thei brouyten hym in to Gion.
39 And Sadoch, the preest, took an horn of oile of the tabernacle, and anoyntide Salomon; and thei sungen with a clarioun; and al the puple seide, Lyue kyng Salomon!
40 And al the multitude stiede after hym, and the puple of men syngynge with pipis, and `of men beynge glad with greet ioye, `stiede aftir hym; and the erthe sownede of the cry of hem.
41 Forsothe Adonye herde, and alle that weren clepid of hym to feeste; and thanne the feeste was endid. But also Joab seide, whanne the vois of trumpe was herd, What wole it to it silf the cry of the citee makynge noise?
42 Yit the while he spak, Jonathan, sone of Abiathar, the preest, cam; to whom Adonye seide, Entre thou, for thou art a strong man, and tellynge goode thingis.
43 And Jonathan answeride to Adonye, Nay; for oure lord the kyng Dauid hath ordeyned Salomon kyng;
44 and Dauid sente with Salomon Sadoch, the preest, and Nathan, the prophete, and Banaie, sone of Joiada, and Cerethi, and Ferethi; and thei puttiden Salomon on the mule of the kyng.
45 And Sadoch, the preest, and Nathan, the prophete, anoyntiden hym kyng in Gion; and thei camen doun fro thennus beynge glad, and the citee sownede; this is the vois which ye herden.
46 But also Salomon sittith on the trone of rewme;
47 and the seruauntis of the kyng entriden, and blessiden oure lord the kyng Dauid, and seiden, God make large the name of Salomon aboue thi name, and magnyfye his trone aboue thi trone. And kyng Dauid worschipide in his bed;
48 and ferthermore he spak these thingis, Blessid be the Lord God of Israel, that yaf to dai a sittere in my trone, while myn iyen seen.
49 Therfor alle, that weren clepid of Adonye to feeste, weren aferd, and risiden, and ech man yede in to his weie.
50 Sotheli Adonye dredde Salomon, and roos, and yede in to the tabernacle of the Lord, and helde the horn of the auter.
51 And thei telden to Salomon, and seiden, Lo! Adonye dredith the kyng Salomon, and holdith the horn of the auter, and seith, Kyng Salomon swere to me to dai, that he schal not sle his seruaunt bi swerd.
52 And Salomon seide, If he is a good man, sotheli not oon heer of hym schal falle in to erthe; but if yuel be foundun in hym, he schal die.
53 Therfor kyng Salomon sente, and ledde `hym out fro the auter; and he entride, and worschipide kyng Salomon; and Salomon seide to hym, Go in to thin hows.

CAP 2
1 Forsothe the daies of Dauid neiyiden, that he schulde die; and he comaundide to Salomon, his sone, and seide, Lo!
2 Y entre in to the weie of al erthe; be thou coumfortid, and be thou a strong man.
3 And kepe thou the kepyngis and heestis of thi Lord God, that thou go in hise weies, and kepe hise cerymonyes, and hise heestis, and hise domes, and witnessyngis, as it is writun in the lawe of Moises; that thou vndurstonde alle thingis whiche thou doist, and whidur euer thou schalt turne thee.
4 That the Lord conferme hise wordis, whiche the Lord spak of me, and seide, If thi sones kepen my weies, and goen bifor me in treuthe, in al her herte, and in al her soule, a man schal not be takun awei of thee fro the trone of Israel.
5 Also thou knowist what thingis Joab, the sone of Saruye, dide to me; what thingis he dide to twey princis of the oost of Israel, to Abner, sone of Ner, and to Amasa, sone of Jether, whiche he killide, and schedde the blood of batel in pees; and puttide the blood of batel in his girdil, that was aboute hise leendis, and in his scho, that was in hise feet.
6 Therfor thou schalt do by thi wisdom, and thou schalt not lede forth his hoornesse pesibli to hellis.
7 But also thou schalt yelde grace to the sones of Bersellai of Galaad, and thei schulen be eetynge in thi boord; for thei metten me, whanne Y fledde fro the face of Absolon, thi brother.
8 Also thou hast anentis thee Semey, sone of Gera, sone of Gemyny, of Bahurym, which Semei curside me bi the worste cursyng, whanne Y yede to `the castels; but for he cam doun to me in to metyng, whanne Y passide Jordan, and Y swoor to him bi the Lord, and seide, Y schal not slee thee bi swerd,
9 nyle thou suffre hym to be vnpunyschid; forsothe thou art a wise man, and thou schalt wite what thou schalt do to hym, and thou schalt lede forth hise hoor heeris with blood to hellis.
10 Sotheli Dauid slepte with hise fadris, and was biriede in the citee of Dauid.
11 Forsothe the daies, in whiche Dauid regnede on Israel, ben fourti yeer; in Ebron he regned seuene yeer, in Jerusalem thre and thretti yeer.
12 Forsothe Salomon sat on the trone of Dauid, his fadir, and his rewme was maad stidfast greetli.
13 And Adonye, sone of Agith, entride to Bersabee, modir of Salomon; and sche seide to hym, Whether thin entryng is pesible? And he answeride, It is pesible.
14 And he addide, A word of me is to thee. `To whom sche seide, Speke thou.
15 And he seide, Thou knowist that the rewme was myn, and al Israel purposide to make me in to king to hem; but the rewme is translatid, and is maad my brotheris; for of the Lord it is ordeyned to hym.
16 Now therfor Y preye of the oon axyng; schende thou not my face. And sche seide to hym, Speke thou. And he seide, Y preie,
17 that thou seie to Salomon the king; for he may not denye ony thing to thee; that he yyue to me Abisag of Sunam wijf.
18 And Bersabee seide, Wel, Y schal speke for thee to the kyng.
19 Therfor Bersabee cam to kyng Salomon, to speke to hym for Adonye; and the kyng roos ayens the comyng of hir, and worschipide hir, and `sat on his trone; and a trone was set to the modir of the kyng, and sche sat at his riyt side.
20 And sche seide to hym, Y preie of thee o litil axyng; schende thou not my face. And the kyng seide to hir, My modir, axe thou; for it is not leueful that Y turne awei thi face.
21 And sche seide, Abisag of Sunam be youun wijf to Adonye, thi brother.
22 And kyng Salomon answeride, and seide to his modir, Whi axist thou Abisag of Sunam to Adonye? Axe thou to hym also the rewme; for he is `my gretter brothir, and he hath Abiathar, preest, and Joab, sone of Saruye.
23 Therfor kyng Salomon swoor bi the Lord, and seide, God do to me these thingis, and adde these thinges, for Adonie spak this word ayens his lijf.
24 And now the Lord lyueth, that confermede me, and hath set me on the trone of my fadir, and that hath maad to me an hows, as he spak, for Adonye schal be slayn to dai.
25 And kyng Salomon sente bi the hond of Banaie, sone of Joiada; which Banaie killide Adonye, and he was deed.
26 Also the kyng seide to Abiathar, preest, Go thou in to Anatot, to thi feeld; and sotheli thou art a man of deeth, `that is, worthi the deeth, for conspiryng ayens me, and the ordynaunce of God, and of my fadir; but to dai Y schal not sle thee, for thou barist the arke of the Lord God bifor Dauid, my fadir, and thou suffridist trauele in alle thingis, in whiche my fadir trauelide.
27 Therfor Salomon puttide out Abiathar, that he schulde not be preest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord were fillid, which he spak on the hows of Heli, in Silo.
28 Forsothe a messager cam to Salomon, that Joab hadde bowid aftir Adonye, and that he hadde not bowid after Salomon. Therfor Joab fledde in to the tabernacle of the Lord, and took the horn of the auter.
29 And it was teld to kyng Salomon, that Joab hadde fledde in to the tabernacle of the Lord, and was bisidis the auter; and Salomon sente Banaie, sone of Joiada, and seide, Go thou, and sle hym.
30 And Banaie cam to the tabernacle of the Lord, and seide to Joab, The kyng seith these thingis, Go thou out. And he seide, Y schal not go out, but Y schal die here. Banaie telde the word to the kyng, and seide, Joab spak thes thingis, and answeride these thingis to me.
31 And the kyng seide to Banaie, Do thou as he spak, and sle thou hym, and birie him; and thou schalt remoue the innocent blood, that was sched out of Joab, fro me, and fro the hows of my fadir.
32 And the Lord yelde on his heed his blood, for he killide twei iust men, and betere than hym silf, and he killide hem bi swerd, while Dauid, my fadir, `wiste not, Abner, the sone of Ner, the prince of the chyualrie of Israel, and Amasa, sone of Jether, the prince of the oost of Juda.
33 And the blood of hem schal turne ayen in to the heed of Joab, and in to the heed of his seed with outen ende; forsothe pees be of the Lord til in to with outen ende to Dauid, and to his seed, and to the hous and trone of hym.
34 Therfor Banaie, sone of Joiada, stiede, and asailide, and killide Joab; and Joab was biried in his hows in deseert.
35 And the kyng ordeynede Banaie, sone of Joiada, on the oost for hym; and the kyng puttide Sadoch preest for Abiathar.
36 Also the kyng sente, and clepide Semey, and seide to hym, Bilde to thee an hows in Jerusalem, and dwelle thou there, and thou schalt not go out fro thennus hidur and thidur;
37 sotheli in what euer dai thou goist out, and passist the stronde of Cedron, wite thou thee worthi to be slayn; thi blood schal be on thin heed.
38 And Semei seide to the kyng, The word of the kyng is good; as my lord the kyng spak, so thi seruaunt schal do. Therfor Semey dwellide in Jerusalem in many daies.
39 Forsothe it was doon after thre yeer, that the seruauntis of Semei fledden to Achis, sone of Maacha, the kyng of Geth; and it was teld to Semey, that hise seruauntis hadden go in to Geth.
40 And Semey roos, and sadlide his asse, and yede to Achis, in to Geth, to seke hise seruauntis; and brouyte hem ayen fro Geth.
41 Forsothe it was teld to kyng Salomon, that Semey hadde go to Geth fro Jerusalem, and hadde come ayen.
42 And Salomon sente, and clepide hym, and seide to hym, Whether Y witnessede not to thee bi the Lord, and bifor seide to thee, In what euer dai thou schalt go out hidur and thidur, wite thou that thou schalt die; and thou answeridist to me, The word is good, which Y herde?
43 Whi therfor keptist thou not the ooth of the Lord, and the comaundement which Y comaundide to thee?
44 And the kyng seide to Semei, Thou knowist al the yuel, of which thin herte is gilti to thee, which yuel thou didist to my fadir; the Lord hath yolde thi malice in to thin heed.
45 And kyng Salomon schal be blessid; and the trone of Dauid schal be stable bifor the Lord til in to with outen ende.
46 Therfor the kyng comaundide to Banaie, sone of Joiada; and he assailide, and smoot Semey, and he was deed.

CAP 3
1 Therfor the rewme was confermyd in to the hondis of Salomon; and bi affynyte, `ether aliaunce, he was ioyned to Pharao, kyng of Egipt; for he took the douyter of Farao, and brouyte in to the citee of Dauid, til he `fillide bildynge his hows, and the hows of the Lord, and the wal of Jerusalem bi cumpas.
2 Netheles the puple offride in hiye places; for the temple was not bildid to the name of the Lord til in to that dai.
3 Forsothe Salomon louyde the Lord, and yede in the comaundementis of Dauid, his fadir, out takun that Salomon offride in hiye placis, and brente encense `in hiye places.
4 Therfor Salomon yede in to Gabaon, to offre there; for thilke was the moost hiy place. Salomon offride on that auter in Gabaon a thousynde offryngis in to brent sacrifice.
5 Sotheli the Lord apperide to Salomon bi sleep in the nyyt, and seide, Axe thou `that, that thou wolt, that Y yyue to thee.
6 And Salomon seide, Thou hast do greet merci with thi seruaunt Dauid, my fadir, as he yede in thi siyt, in treuthe, and riytfulnesse, and riytful herte with thee; thou hast kepte to hym thi greet merci, and hast youun to hym a sone, sittynge on his trone, as it is to dai.
7 And now, Lord God, thou hast maad thi seruaunt to regne for Dauid, my fadir; forsothe Y am a litil child, and not knowynge myn outgoynge and entryng.
8 And thi seruaunt is in the myddis of the puple, which thou hast chose, of puple with outen noumbre, that may not be noumbrid and rikened, for multitude.
9 Therfor thou schalt yyue to thi seruaunt an herte able to be tauyt, `that is, liytned of thee, that he may deme the puple, and iuge bitwixe good and yuel; for who may deme this puple, thi puple, this miche puple?
10 Therfor the world pleside bifore the Lord, that Salomon hadde axid sich a thing.
11 And the Lord seide to Salomon, For thou axidist this word, and axidist not to thee many daies, nether richessis, nether the lyues of thin enemyes, but thou axidist to thee wisdom to deme doom, lo!
12 Y haue do to thee vpe thi wordis, and Y haue youe to thee a wyse herte and vndirstondynge, in so myche that no man bifor thee was lijk thee, nether schal rise aftir thee.
13 But also Y haue youe to thee these thingis, whiche thou axidist not, that is, richessis, and glorie, that no man be lijk thee in kyngis in alle tymes aftirward.
14 Forsothe if thou goist in my weies, and kepist my biddyngis and comaundementis, as thi fadir yede, Y schal make thi daies long.
15 Therfor Salomon wakide, and vndirstood what the sweuen was. And whanne he hadde come to Jerusalem, he stood bifor the arke of boond of pees of the Lord, and he offride brent sacrifices, and made pesible sacrifices, and a greet feeste to alle hise meynees.
16 Thanne twei wymmen hooris camen to the kyng, and stoden bifor hym;
17 of whiche oon seide, My lord, Y biseche, Y and this womman dwelliden in oon hows, and Y childide at hir in a couche.
18 Sotheli in the thridde dai aftir that Y childide, also this womman childide; and we weren togidere in the hows, and noon other was with vs in the hows, outakun vs tweyne.
19 Forsothe the sone of this womman was deed in the nyyt, for sche slepte, and oppresside hym;
20 and sche roos in the fourthe part of the nyyt in silence, and took my sone fro the side of me, thin handmaide slepynge, and settide in hir bosum; forsothe sche puttide in my bosum hir sone, that was deed.
21 And whanne Y hadde ryse eerli, to yyue mylk to my sone, he apperide deed; whom Y bihelde diligentlier bi cleer liyt, and Y perseyuede, that he was not myn, whom Y hadde gendrid.
22 The tother womman answeride, It is not so as thou seist, but thi sone is deed; forsothe `my sone lyueth. Ayenward sche seide, Thou liest; for my sone lyueth, and thi sone is deed. And bi this maner thei stryueden bifore the kyng.
23 Thanne the kyng seide, This womman seith, My sone lyueth, and thi sone is deed; and this womman answerith, Nay, but thi sone is deed; forsothe my sone lyueth.
24 Therfor the kyng seide, Brynge ye to me a swerd. And whanne thei hadden brouyt a swerd bifor the kyng,
25 he seide, Departe ye the quyk yong child in to twei partis, and yyue ye the half part to oon, and the half part to the tother.
26 Forsothe the womman, whos sone was quik, seide to the kyng; for her entrailis weren mouyd on hir sone; Lord, Y biseche, yyue ye to hir the quik child, and nyle ye sle hym. Ayenward sche seide, Be he nethir to me, nether to thee, but be he departid.
27 The kyng answeride, and seide, Yyue ye to this womman the yong child quyk, and be he not slayn; forsothe this is `his modir.
28 Therfor al Israel herde the doom, which the kyng hadde demyd; and thei dredden the kyng, and sien, that the wisdom of God was in hym, to make doom.

CAP 4

20 Juda and Israel weren vnnoumbrable, as the soond of the see in multitude, etynge, and drynkynge, and beynge glad.
21 Forsothe Solomon was in his lordschip, and hadde alle rewmes, as fro the flood of the lond of Filisteis `til to the laste part of Egipt, of men offrynge yiftis to hym, and seruynge to hym, in alle the daies of his lijf.
22 Forsothe the mete of Salomon was bi ech day, thritti chorus of clene flour of whete, and sixti chorus of mele,
23 ten fatte oxis, and twenti oxis of lesewe, and an hundrid wetheris, outakun huntyng of hertys, of geet, and of buglis, and of briddis maad fat.
24 For he helde al the cuntrei that was biyende the flood, as fro Caphsa `til to Gasa, and alle the kyngis of tho cuntreis; and he hadde pees bi ech part in cumpas.
25 And Juda and Israel dwelliden withouten ony drede, ech man vndur his vyne, and vndur his fige tree, fro Dan `til to Bersabe, in alle the daies of Salomon.

32 And Salomon spak thre thousynde parablis, and hise songis weren fyue thousynde;
33 and he disputide of trees fro a cedre which is in the Lyban, `til to the ysope that goith out of the wal; he disputide of werk beestis, and briddis, and crepynge beestis, and fischis.
34 And thei camen fro alle puplis to here the wisdom of Salomon, and fro alle kyngis of erthe, that herden his wisdom.

CAP 5
1 Also Hiram, kyng of Tire, sente hise seruauntis to Salomon; for he herde that thei hadden anoyntide hym kyng for his fadir; for Hiram was frend of Dauid in al time.
2 Sotheli also Salomon sente to Hiram,
3 and seide, Thou knowist the wille of Dauid, my fadir, and for he miyte not bilde an hows to the name of his God, for batels neiyynge bi cumpas, til the Lord yaf hem vndur the step of hise feet.
4 Now forsothe my Lord God yaf reste to me bi cumpas, and noon aduersarie is, nethir yuel asailyng;
5 wherfor Y thenke to buylde a temple to the name of my Lord God, as God spak to Dauid, my fadir, and seide, Thi sone, whom Y schal yyue to thee for thee on thi trone, he schal bilde an hows to my name.
6 Therfor comaunde thou, that thi seruauntis hewe doun to me cedris of the Liban; and my seruauntis be with thi seruauntis; sotheli Y schal yyue to thee the meede of thi seruauntis, what euere meede thou schalt axe; for thou woost, that in my puple is not a man that kan hewe trees, as Sidonyes kunnen.
7 Therfor whanne Hiram hadde herde the wordis of Salomon, he was ful glad, and seide, Blessid be the Lord God to dai, that yaf to Dauid a sone moost wijs on this puple ful myche.
8 And Hiram sente to Salomon, and seide, Y haue herde what euer thingis thou sentist to me; Y schal do al thi wille, in trees of cedres, and of beechis.
9 My seruauntis schulen putte doun tho trees fro the Liban to the see, and Y schal araye tho trees in schippis in the see, `til to the place which thou schalt signyfie to me; and Y schal dresse tho there, that thou take tho; and thou schalt yyue necessaries to me, that mete be youun to myn hows.
10 Therfor Hiram yaf to Salomon `trees of cedres, and `trees of beechis, bi al his wille;
11 forsothe Salomon yaf to Hiram twenti thousynde chorus of wheete, in to meete to his hows, and twenti chorus of pureste oile; Salomon yaf these thingis to Hiram bi alle yeeris.
12 Also the Lord yaf wisdom to Salomon, as he spak to hym; and pees was bitwixe Hiram and Salomon, and bothe smytiden boond of pees.
13 And kyng Salomon chees werk men of al Israel; and the summe was thretti thousynde of men.
14 And `Salomon sente hem in to the Liban, ten thousynde bi ech monethe bi whilis, so that in twei monethis bi whilis thei weren in her howsis; and Adonyram was on sich a summe.
15 Therfor seuenti thousynde of hem, that baren burthuns, weren to Salomon, and foure score thousynde of masouns in the hil, with out the souereyns,
16 that weren maistris of alle werkis, bi the noumbre of thre thousynde and thre hundrid, comaundynge to the puple, and to hem that maden werk.
17 And the kyng comaundide, that thei schulden take greete stonys, `and preciouse stonys, in to the foundement of the temple, and that thei schulden make tho square;
18 whiche stoonys the masouns of Salomon, and the masouns of Hyram, hewiden. Forsothe Biblies maden redi trees and stonus, to the hows to be bildid.

CAP 6
1 Forsothe it was doon in the fourthe hundrid and fourescore yeer of the goynge out of the sones of Israel fro the lond of Egipt, in the fourthe yeer, in the monethe Zio; thilke is the secounde monethe of the rewme of Salomon on Israel; he bigan to bilde an hows to the Lord.
2 Forsothe the hows which kyng Salomon bildide to the Lord, hadde sexti cubitis in lengthe, and twenti cubitis in breede, and thretti cubitis in heiythe.
3 And a porche was bifor the temple of twenti cubitis of lengthe, by the mesure of the breed of the temple; and the porche hadde ten cubitis of breede, bifor the face of the temple.
4 And Salomon made in the temple `wyndows streyte withoutforth, and large with ynne.
5 And he bildide on the wal of the temple bildyngis of tablis bi cumpas, in the wallis of the hows, `bi cumpas of the temple, and of Goddis answeryng place; and he made sidis in the cumpas.
6 The bildyng of tablis, that was vndur, hadde fyue cubitis of breede; and the myddil bildyng of tablis was of sixe cubits of breede; and the thridde bildyng of tablis was hauynge seuene cubitis of breede. Sotheli he puttide beemys in the hous bi cumpas with outforth, that tho cleuiden not to the wallis of the temple.
7 Forsothe whanne the hows was bildid, it was bildid of `stoonys hewid and perfit; and an hamer, and ax, and al thing maad of yrun, weren not herd in the hows, while it was in bildyng.
8 The dore of the myddil side was in the wal of the riythalf hows; and bi a vijs thei stieden in to the myddil soler, and fro the myddil soler in to the thridde soler.
9 And Salomon bildide the hows, and endide it. Also Salomon hilide the hows with couplis of cedre,
10 and bildide a bildyng of tablis ouer al the hows, bi fyue cubitis of heiythe, and hilide the hows with `trees of cedre.
11 And the word of the Lord was maad to Salomon, and seide,
12 This is the hows, which thou bildist; if thou gost in myn heestis, and dost my domes, and kepist alle my comaundementis, and goist bi tho, Y schal make stidefast my word to thee, `which word Y spak to Dauid, thi fadir;
13 and Y schal dwelle in the myddis of the sones of Israel, and Y schal not forsake my puple Israel.
14 Therfor Salomon bildide the hows, and endide it;
15 and he bildide the wallis of the hows with ynne with tablis of cedre, fro the pawment of the hows `til to the heiynesse of the wal, and `til to the couplis; and hilide with trees of cedre with ynne; and he hilide the pawment of the hows with tablis of beeche.
16 And he bildide a wal of tablis of cedre of twenti cubitis at the hyndrere part of the temple, fro the pawment `til to the hiyere partis; and he made the ynnere hows of Goddis answeryng place, in to the hooli of hooli thingis.
17 Sotheli thilke temple bifor the doris of Goddis answering place was of fourti cubitis.
18 And al the hows with ynne was clothid with cedre, and hadde hise smethenessis, and hise ioynyngis maad suteli, and grauyngis apperynge aboue; alle thingis weren clothid with tablis of cedre, and outirli a stoon miyte not appere in the wal.
19 Forsothe Salomon made Goddis answeryng place in the myddis of the hows, in the ynnere part, that he schulde sette there the arke of boond of pees of the Lord.
20 Sotheli Goddis answeryng place hadde twenti cubitis of lengthe, and twenti cubitis of breede, and twenti cubitis of hiyte; and he hilide, and clothide it with pureste gold; but also he clothide the auter with cedre.
21 Also he hilide with pureste gold the hows bifor `Goddis answeryng place, and fastnyde platis with goldun nailis.
22 No thing was in the temple, `which thing was not hilid with gold; but also he hilid with gold al the auter of Goddis answeryng place.
23 And he made in `Goddis answeryng place twey cherubyns of the trees of olyues, of ten cubits of heiyte;
24 o wynge of cherub was of fyue cubitis, and the tother wynge of cherub was of fyue cubitis, that is, hauynge ten cubitis, fro the heiynesse of `the o wynge `til to the hiynesse of the tother wynge.
25 And the secunde cherub was of ten cubitis in euene mesure; and o werk was in the twey cherubyns,
26 that is, o cherub hadde the hiythe of ten cubitis, and in lijk maner the tother cherub.
27 And he settide cherubyns in the myddis of the ynnere temple; forsothe the cherubyns helden forth her wyngis, and o wenge touchide the wal, and the wynge of the secunde cherub touchide the tother wal; forsothe the othere wyngis in the middil part of the temple touchiden hem silf togidere.
28 And he hilide the cherubyns with gold,
29 and alle the wallis of the temple `bi cumpas; and grauyde with dyuerse grauyngis and smethenesse; and he made in tho wallys cherubyns, and palmes, and dyuerse peynturis, as stondinge forth and goynge out of the wal.
30 But also he hilide with gold the pawment of the hows, withynne and with outforthe.
31 And in the entryng of `Goddis answering place he made twei litil doris of the trees of olyues; and he made postis of fyue corneris,
32 and twei doris of the trees of olyues; and grauyde in tho the peynture of cherubyns, and the licnessis of palmes, and grauyngis aboue stondynge forth gretli; and he hilide tho with gold; and he hilide as wel the cherubyns, as palmes, and othere thingis with gold.
33 And in the entring of the temple he made postis foure cornerid of the trees of olyues;
34 and he made twei doris of the trees of beech, ech ayens other; and euer either dore was double, and it was openyd holdynge it silf togidere.
35 And he grauyde cherubyns, and palmes, and grauyngis apperynge greetli; and he hilide alle thingis with goldun platis, bi square werk at reule.
36 And he bildide a large street with ynne, bi thre ordris of stoonys maad fair, and bi oon ordre of trees of cedre.
37 The hows of the Lord was foundid in the fourthe yeer, in the monethe Zio;
38 and the hows was maad perfit in al his werk, and in alle vessels, ether `purtenauncis, in the eleuenthe yeer, in the monethe Zebul; thilke is the eiythe monethe; and he bildide that hows in seuene yeer.

CAP 7
1 Forsothe Salomon bildide his owne hows in thrittene yeer, and brouyte it til to perfeccioun.
2 He bildide an hows of the forest of Liban, of an hundrid cubitis of lengthe, and of fifti cubitis of breede, and of thretti cubitis of hiythe; and he bildide foure aleis bitwixe the pilers of cedre; for he hadde hewe doun trees of cedres in to pilers.
3 And he clothide al the chaumbir with wallis of cedris; which chaumbir was susteyned with fyue and fourti pileris. Sotheli oon ordre hadde fiftene pileris, set ayens hem silf togidere,
4 and biholdynge hem silf euene ayens, bi euene space bitwixe the pilers;
5 and on the pilers weren foure square trees, euene in alle thingis.
6 And he made a porche of pilers of fifti cubitis of lengthe, and of thritti cubitis of breede; and `he made an other porche in the face of the gretter porche; and he made pileris, and pomels on the pileris.
7 Also he maad a porche of the kyngis seete, in which the seete of doom was; and he hilide with trees of cedre, fro the pawment `til to the hiynesse.
8 And a litil hows, in which he sat to deme, was in the myddil porche, bi lijk werk. Also Salomon made an hows to the douyter of Farao, whom he hadde weddid, bi sich werk, bi what maner werk he made and this porche.
9 He made alle thingis of preciouse stoonys, that weren sawid at sum reule and mesure, bothe with ynne and with outforth, fro the foundement `til to the hiynesse of wallis, and with ynne and `til to the gretter street, ethir court.
10 Sotheli the foundementis weren of preciouse stoonys, grete stoonys of ten, ethir of eiyte cubitis;
11 and preciouse stoonys hewun of euene mesure weren aboue; in lijk maner and of cedre.
12 And the gretter court, `ethir voide space, was round, of thre ordris of hewun stonus, and of oon ordre of hewun cedre; also and in the ynnere large strete of the hows of the Lord, and in the porche of the hows of the Lord.
13 Also kyng Salomon sente, and brouyte fro Tire Hiram, the sone of a womman widewe,
14 of the lynage of Neptalym, of the fadir a man of Tyre, Hiram, a crafty man of brasse, and ful of wisdom, and vndirstondynge, and doctryn, to make al werk of bras. And whanne he hadde come to kyng Salomon, he made al hys werk.
15 And he made twey pilers of bras, o piler of eiytene cubitis of hiythe; and a lyne of twelue cubitis cumpasside euer either piler.
16 Also he made twei pomels, yotun of bras, that weren set on the heedis of the pilers; o pomel of fyue cubitis of hiythe, and the tothir pomel of fyue cubitis of heiythe; and bi the maner of a net,
17 and of chaynes knyt to gidere to hem, bi wonderful werk. Euer either pomel of the pilers was yotun; seuen werkis lijk nettis of orders weren in o pomel, and seuen werkis lijk nettis weren in the tother pomel.
18 And he made perfitli the pilers, and twei ordris `bi cumpas of alle werkis lijk nettis, that tho schulden hile the pomels, that weren on the hiynesse of pumgarnadis; in the same maner he dide also to the secounde pomel.
19 Sotheli the pomels, that weren on the heedis of the pilers in the porche, weren maad as bi the werk of lilye, of foure cubitis;
20 and eft othere pomels in the hiynesse of pilers aboue, bi the mesure of the piler, ayens the werkis lijk nettis; forsothe twey hundrid ordris of pumgarnadis weren in the cumpas of the secounde pomel.
21 And he settide the twey pilers in the porche of the temple; and whanne he hadde set the riythalf pilere, he clepide it bi name Jachym; in lijk maner he reiside the secounde pilere, and he clepide the name therof Booz.
22 And he settide on the heedis of the pilers a werk bi the maner of a lilie; and the werk of the pilers was maad perfit.
23 Also he made a yotun see, that is, a waisching vessel for preestis, round in cumpas, of ten cubitis fro brynke til to the brinke; the heiynesse therof was of fyue cubitis; and a corde of thretti cubitis yede aboute it bi cumpas.
24 And grauyng vndir the brynke cumpasside it, and cumpasside the see bi ten cubitis; tweyne ordris of grauyngis conteynynge summe stories weren yotun, and stoden on twelue oxis;
25 of whiche oxis thre bihelden to the north, and thre to the west, and thre to the south, and three to the eest; and the see was aboue on tho oxis, of whiche alle the hyndere thingis weren hid `with ynne.
26 Sotheli the thicknesse of the see was of thre ounces, and the brynke therof was as the brynke of a cuppe, and as the leef of a lilie crokid ayen; the see took twei thousynde bathus, thre thousynde metretis.
27 And he made ten brasun foundementes, ech foundement of foure cubites of lengthe, and of foure cubitis of brede, and of thre cubitis of hiynes.
28 And thilke werk of foundementis was rasid bitwixe; and grauyngis weren bitwixe the ioynturis.
29 And bitwixe the litil corouns and serclis weren liouns, oxis, and cherubyns; and in the ioynturis in lijk maner aboue; and vndir the lyouns and oxis weren as reynes of bridels of bras hangynge doun.
30 And bi ech foundement weren foure wheelis, and brasun extrees; and bi foure partis weren as litle schuldryngis vndir the waischyng vessel, `the schuldryngis yotun, and biholdynge ayens hemsilf togidere.
31 And the mouth of the waischyng vessel with ynne was in the hiynesse of the heed, and that, that apperide with outforth, was of o cubit, and it was al round, and hadde togidere o cubit and an half; sotheli dyuerse grauyngis weren in the corneris of pilers, and the mydil piler bitwixe was square, not round.
32 And the foure wheelis, that weren bi foure corneris of the foundement, cleuyden togidere to hem silf vndir the foundement; o wheele hadde o cubit and an half of hiythe.
33 Sotheli the wheelis weren siche, whiche maner wheelis ben wont to be maad in a chare; and the extrees, and the `naue stockis, and the spokis, and dowlis of tho wheelis, alle thingis weren yotun.
34 For also the foure litle schuldryngis, bi alle the corners of o foundement, weren ioyned to gidere, and yotun of that foundement.
35 Sotheli in the hiynesse of the foundement was sum roundenesse, of o cubite and an half, so maad craftili, that the waischyng vessel myyte be set aboue, hauynge his purtreiyngis, and dyuerse grauyngis of it silf.
36 Also he grauyde in tho wallis, that weren of bras, and in the corneris, cherubyns, and liouns, and palmes, as bi the licnesse of a man stondynge, that tho semeden not grauun, but put to bi cumpas.
37 Bi this maner he made ten foundementis, bi o yetyng and mesure, and lijk grauyng.
38 Also he made ten waischyng vessels of bras; o waischyng vessel took fourti bathus, and it was of foure cubitis; and he puttide ech waischyng vessel bi it silf bi ech foundement bi it silf, that is, ten.
39 And he made ten foundementis, fyue at the riyt half of the temple, and fyue at the left half; sotheli he settide the see at the riyt half of the temple, ayens the eest, at the south.
40 Also Hiram made cawdrouns, and pannes, and wyn vessels; and he made perfitli al the werk of kyng Salomon in the temple of the Lord.
41 He made twey pilers, and twei cordis of pomels on the pomels of pilers, and twei werkis lijk nettis, that tho schulden hile twey cordis, that weren on the heedis of pileris.
42 And `he made pumgarnadis foure hundrid in twey werkis lijk nettis; `he made tweyne ordris of pumgarnadis in ech werk lijk a net, to hile the cordis of the pomels, that weren on the heedis of pilers.
43 And he made ten foundementis, and ten waischyng vessels on the foundementis;
44 and o se, `that is, a waischyng vessel for preestis, and twelue oxis vndur the see;
45 and `he made cawdruns, and pannys, and wyn vessels. Alle vessels, whiche Hiram made to kyng Salomon in the hows of the Lord, weren of latoun.
46 And the kyng yetide tho vessels in the feeldi cuntrey of Jordan, in cleyi lond, bitwixe Sochot and Sarcham.
47 And Salomon settide alle the vessels; forsothe for greet multitude no weiyte was of bras, `that is, it passide al comyn weiyte.
48 And Salomon made alle vessels in the hows of the Lord; sotheli he made the golden auter, `that is, the auter of encense, that was with ynne the temple, and the goldun boord, on whych the loouys of settynge forth weren set;
49 and he made goldun candilstikis, fyue at the riyt half, and fyue at the left half, ayens Goddis answerynge place, `of purest gold; and he made as the flouris of a lilie, and goldun lanterns aboue, and goldun tongis; and pottis,
50 and hokis, and violis, and morteris, and censeris of pureste gold; and the herris, ether heengis, of the doris of the ynnere hows of the hooli of hooli thingis, and of the doris of the hows of the temple weren of gold.
51 And Salomon performyde al the werk, which he made in the hows of the Lord; and he brouyte ynne the thingis, whiche Dauid, his fadir, hadde halewid; siluer, and gold, and vessels; and he kepte in the tresours of the hows of the Lord.

CAP 8
1 Thanne alle the gretter men in birthe in Israel, with the princes of lynagis, and the duykis of meynees of the sones of Israel, weren gaderid to kyng Salomon, in to Jerusalem, that thei schulden bere the arke of boond of pees of the Lord fro the citee of Dauid, that is, fro Syon.
2 And al Israel cam to gidere in the moneth Bethanym, in the solempne dai; thilke is the seuenthe moneth.
3 And alle the elde men of Israel camen; and the preestis token the arke,
4 and baren the arke of the Lord, and the tabernacle of boond of pees, and alle vessels of the seyntuarye, that weren in the tabernacle; and the preestis and dekenes baren tho.
5 Sotheli kyng Salomon, and al the multitude of Israel, that camen togidere to hym, yede with hym bifor the arke; and thei offriden scheep and oxis, with out gessyng and noumbre.
6 And prestis brouyten the arke of boond of pees of the Lord in to his place, in to Goddis answerynge place of the temple, in to the hooli of hooli thingis, vndur the wengis of cherubyns.
7 Forsothe cherubyns spredden forth wengis ouer the place of the arke; and hiliden the arke, and the barris therof aboue.
8 And whanne the barris stoden forth, and the hiynesse of tho apperiden with out the seyntuarye, bifor `Goddis answerynge place, tho apperyden no ferther with outforth; whiche barris also weren there `til in to present day.
9 Forsothe in the arke is noon other thing, no but twei tablis of stoon, whiche tablis Moyses in Oreb hadde put in the ark, whanne the Lord made boond of pees with the sones of Israel, whanne thei yeden out of the loond of Egipt.
10 Forsothe it was doon whanne the preestis hadden go out of the seyntuarie, a cloude fillide the hows of the Lord;
11 and the preestis myyten not stonde and mynystre, for the cloude; for whi the glorye of the Lord hadde fillid the hows of the Lord.
12 Thanne Salomon seide, The Lord seide, that he wolde dwelle in a cloude.
13 Y bildynge haue bildid an hows in to thi dwelling place, in to thi moost stidefast trone with outen ende.
14 And the kyng turnede his face, and blesside al the chirche in Israel; for al the chirche of Israel stood.
15 And Salomon seide, Blessid be the Lord God of Israel, that spak with his mouth to Dauid, my fadir, and performyde in hise hondis, and seide,
16 Fro the dai in which Y ledde my puple Israel out of Egipt, Y chees not a citee of alle the lynagis of Israel, that an hows schulde be bildid, and my name schulde be there; but Y chees Dauid, that he schulde be ouer my puple Israel.
17 And Dauid, my fadir, wolde bilde an hows to the name of the Lord God of Israel.
18 And the Lord seide to Dauid, my fadir, That thou thouytist in thin herte to bilde an hows to my name, thou didist wel, tretynge this same thing in soule;
19 netheles thou schalt not bilde an hows to me, but thi sone, that schal go out of thi reynes, he schal bilde an hows to my name.
20 The Lord hath confermyd his word, which he spak; and Y stood for Dauid, my fadir, and Y sat on the trone of Israel, as the Lord spak; and Y haue bildid an hows to the name of the Lord God of Israel.
21 And Y haue ordeyned there a place of the arke, in which arke the boond of pees of the Lord is, which he smoot with oure fadris, whanne thei yeden out of the lond of Egipt.
22 Forsothe Salomon stood bifoor the auter of the Lord, in the siyt of the chirch of Israel; and he helde forth hise hondis ayens heuene,
23 and seide, Lord God of Israel, no God in heuene aboue, nether on erthe bynethe, is lijk thee, which kepist couenaunt and mercy to thi seruauntis, that goon bifor thee in al her herte;
24 and thou kepist to Dauid, my fadir, thi seruaunt, tho thingis whiche thou hast spoke to him; bi mouth thou hast spoke, and bi hondis thou hast fillid, as this day preueth.
25 Now therfor, Lord God of Israel, kepe thou to thi seruaunt Dauid, my fadir, tho thingis whiche thou spakist to hym, and seidist, A man of thee schal not be taken awei bifor me, which man schal sitte on the trone of Israel, so netheles if thi sones kepen thi weye, that thei go bifor me, as thou yedist in my siyt.
26 And now, Lord God of Israel, thi wordis be maad stidfast, whiche thou spakist to thi seruaunt Dauid, my fadir.
27 Therfor whether it is to gesse, that God dwellith verily on erthe; for if heuene, and heuene of heuenes moun not take thee, how myche more this hows, which Y bildid to thee, `mai not take thee.
28 But, my Lord God, biholde thou to the preiere of thi seruaunt, and to the bisechyngis of hym; here thou the `ympne, ether preysing, and preiere, which thi seruaunt preieth bifor thee to day;
29 that thin iyen be openyd on this hows bi niyt and dai, on the hows, of which thou seidist, My name schal be there; that thou here the preier, which thi seruaunt preieth to thee in this place; that thou here the bisechyng of thi seruaunt,
30 and of thi puple Israel, what euer thing he preieth in this place, and here thou in the place of thi dwellyng in heuene; and whanne thou hast herd, thou schalt be mercyful.
31 If a man synneth ayens a man, and hath ony ooth, bi which he is holdun boundun, and cometh for the ooth in to thin hows, bifor thin auter, thou schalt here in heuene,
32 and thou schalt do, and thou schalt deme thi seruauntis; and thou schalt condempne the wickid man, and schalt yelde his weie on his heed, and thou schalt iustifie the iust man, and schalt yelde to hym vp his riytfulnesse.
33 If thi puple Israel fleeth hise enemyes, for he schal do synne to thee, and thei doen penaunce, and knoulechen to thi greet name, and comen, and worschipen, and bisechen thee in this hows,
34 here thou in heuene, and foryyue thou the synne of thi puple; and thou schalt lede hem ayen in to the lond, which thou hast youe to the fadris of hem.
35 If heuene is closid, and reyneth not for the synnes of hem, and thei preyen in this place, and doen penaunce to thi name, and ben conuertid fro her synnes for her turment,
36 here thou hem in heuene, and foryyue thou the synnes of thi seruauntis, and of thi puple Israel, and schewe thou to hem good weie, bi which thei schulen go, and yyue thou reyn to hem on the lond, which thou hast youe to hem in to possessioun.
37 If hungur risith in the lond, ether pestilence is, ether corrupt eyr is, ether rust, ether locuste, ether myldew, and his enemy turmentith hym, and bisegith the yatis, al wounde, al sikenesse, al cursyng,
38 and wichyng of yuel, that bifallith to ech man of thi puple Israel, if ony man knowith the wounde of his herte, and holdith forth hise hondis in this hows,
39 thou schalt here in heuene, in the place of thi dwellyng, and thou schalt do mercy, and thou schalt do that thou yyue to ech man vpe alle hise weies, as thou seest his herte; for thou aloone knowist the herte of alle the sones of men,
40 that thei drede thee in alle daies in whiche thei lyuen on the face of the lond, which thou hast youe to oure fadrys.
41 Ferthermore and whanne an alien, which is not of thi puple Israel, cometh fro a fer lond for thi name; for thi grete name, and thi strong hond,
42 and thin arm `holdun forth schal be herd euery where; therfor whanne he cometh, and preieth in this place,
43 thou schalt here in heuene, in the firmament of thi dwellyng place, and thou schalt do alle thingis, for whiche the alien clepith thee, that alle puplis of londis lerne to drede thi name, as thi puple Israel doith, and preue, that thi name is clepid on this hows, which Y bildide.
44 If thi puple goith out to batel ayens hise enemyes, bi the weie whidir euer thou sendist hem, thei schulen preye thee ayens the weie of the citee which thou hast chose, and ayens the hows which Y bildide to thi name,
45 and thou schalt here in heuene the preyeris of hem, and the bisechyngis of hem, and thou schalt make the doom of hem.
46 That if thei synnen to thee, for no man is that synneth not, and thou art wrooth, and bitakist hem to her enemyes, and thei ben led prisoneris in to the lond of enemyes,
47 fer ether nyy, and thei doon penaunce in her herte in the place of prisonyng, and ben conuertid, and bisechen in her prisonyng, and seien, We han synned, we han do wickidli, we han do vnfeithfuli;
48 and thei turnen ayen to thee in al her herte and al her soule, in the lond of her enemyes, to which thei ben led prisoneris, and thei preyen thee ayens the weie of her lond which thou hast youe to her fadris, and of the citee which thou hast chose, and of the temple which Y bildide to thi name, thou schalt here in heuene,
49 in the firmament of thi seete, the preiers of hem, and the bisechingis of hem, and thou shalt make the doom of hem;
50 and thou schalt be merciful to thi puple, that synnede to thee, and to alle the wickidnessis, bi whiche thei trespassiden ayens thee; and thou schalt do merci bifor tho men, that hadden hem prisoneris, that tho men do mercy to hem.
51 For it is thi puple, and thin erytage, whiche thou leddist out of the lond of Egipt, fro the myddis of yrone furneis;
52 that thin yyen be opyn to the bisechyng of thi seruaunt, and of thi puple Israel; and thou schalt here hem in alle thingis, for whiche thei clepen thee.
53 For thou hast departid hem to thee in to heritage fro alle the puplis of erthe, as thou spakist bi Moyses, thi seruaunt, whanne thou, Lord God, leddist oure fadris out of Egipt.
54 Forsothe it was don, whanne Salomon, preiynge the Lord, hadde fillid al this preier and bisechyng, he roos fro the siyt of the auter of the Lord; for he hadde set fast euer either kne to the erthe, and hadde holde forth the hondis to heuene.
55 Therfor he stood, and blesside al the chirche of Israel, and seide with greet vois,
56 Blessid be the Lord God of Israel, that yaf reste to his puple Israel, bi alle thingis whiche he spak; a word felde not doun, sotheli nether oon, of alle goodis whiche he spak bi Moises, his seruaunt.
57 Oure Lord God be with vs, as he was with oure fadris, and forsake not vs, nether caste awey;
58 but bowe he oure hertis to hym silf, that we go in alle hise weies, and kepe hise comaundementis, and cerymonyes, and domes, whiche euere he comaundide to oure fadris.
59 And these wordis of me, bi whiche Y preiede bifor the Lord, be neiyynge to oure Lord God bi dai and niyt, that he make doom to his seruaunt, and to his puple Israel bi alle daies;
60 and alle the puplis of erthe wite, that the Lord hym silf is God, and noon `is ouer `with out hym.
61 Also oure herte be perfit with oure Lord God, that we go in hise domes, and kepe hise comaundementis, as and to dai.
62 Therfor the kyng, and al Israel with hym, offriden sacrifices bifor the Lord.
63 And Salomon killide pesible sacrifices, whiche he offride to the Lord; of oxis two and twenti thousynde, and of scheep sixe score thousynde; and the king and the sones of Israel halewiden the temple of the Lord.
64 In that dai the kyng halewide the myddil of the greet street, that was bifor the hows of the Lord; for he made there brent sacrifice, and sacrifice, and the innere fatnesse of pesible thingis; for the brasun auter that was bifor the Lord, was to litil, and myyte not take the brent sacrifice, and the sacrifice, and the ynnere fatnesse of pesible thingis.
65 Therfor Salomon made in that tyme a solempne feeste, and al Israel with hym, a grete multitude, fro the entryng of Emath `til to the stronde of Egipt, bifor oure Lord God, in seuene daies and seuene daies, that is, fourtene daies.
66 And in the eiythe day he delyueryde the puplis, whiche blessiden the kyng, and yeden forth in to her tabernaclis, and weren glade and of ioyful herte on alle the goodis whiche God hadde do to Dauid, his seruaunt, and to Israel, his puple.

CAP 9
1 Forsothe it was doon, whanne Salomon had perfourmed the bildyng of the hows of the Lord, and the bildyng of the kyng, and al thing that he coueitide, and wolde make,
2 the Lord apperide to Salomon the secunde tyme, as he apperide to hym in Gabaon.
3 And the Lord seide to hym, Y haue herd thi preier, and thi bisechyng, which thou bisouytist bifor me; Y haue halewid this hows, which thou bildidist, that Y schulde sette there my name with outen ende; and myn iyen and myn herte schulen be there in alle daies.
4 Also if thou goist bifore me, as thi fadir yede, in simplenesse of herte, and in equite, and doist alle thingis whiche Y comaundide to thee, and kepist my domes, and my lawful thingis,
5 Y schal sette the trone of thi rewme on Israel with outen ende, as Y spak to Dauid, thi fadir, and seide, A man of thi kyn schal not be takun awei fro the trone of Israel.
6 Forsothe if bi turnyng awei ye and youre sones turnen awey, and suen not me, and kepen not myn hestis and cerymonyes, whiche Y settide forth to you, but ye goen, and worschipen alien goddis, and onouren hem `bi outward reuerence,
7 Y schal do awei Israel fro the face of the lond which Y yaue to hem; and Y schal caste awei fro my siyt the temple, which Y halewid to my name; and Israel schal be in to a prouerbe and in to a fable, to alle puplis.
8 And this hows schal be in to ensaumple of Goddis offence; ech man that schal passe bi it, schal wondre, and schal hisse, and schal seye, Whi hath the Lord do thus to this lond, and to this hows?
9 And thei schulen answere, For thei forsoken her Lord God, that ladde the fadris of hem out of Egipt; and thei sueden alien goddis, and worschipiden hem, and onouriden hem; therfor the Lord brouyte in on hem al this yuel.
10 Sotheli whanne twenti yeer weren fillid, aftir that Salomon hadde bildid tweyne housis, that is, the hows of the Lord, and the hows of the kyng, while Hiram,
11 kyng of Tire, yaf to Salomon trees of cedre, and of beech, and gold, bi al thing that he hadde nedeful; thanne Salomon yaf to Hiram twenti citees in the lond of Galile.
12 And Hiram yede out of Tyre that he schulde se the citees, whiche Salomon hadde youe to hym, and tho plesiden not hym;
13 and he seide, Whethir thes ben the citees, whiche thou, brother, hast youe to me? And he clepide tho citees the lond of Chabul, `til in to this dai.
14 Also Hiram sente to king Salomon sixe score talentis of gold.
15 This is the summe of `costis, which summe Salomon the kyng yaf to bilde the hows of the Lord, and his house Mello, and the wal of Jerusalem, and Ezer, and Maggeddo, and Gazer.
16 Farao, kyng of Egipt, stiede, and took Gazer, and brente it bi fier; and he killide Chananei, that dwellide in the citee, and yaf it in to dower to his douytir, the wijf of Salomon.
17 Therfor Salomon bildide Gazer, and the lower Bethoron,
18 and Balaath, and Palmyra in the lond of wildirnesse;
19 and he made strong alle the townes, that perteyneden to hym, and weren with out wal, and the citees of chaaris, and the citees of knyytis, and what euer thing pleside hym to bilde in Jerusalem, and in the Liban, and in al the lond of his power.
20 Salomon made tributaries `til to this dai al the puple, that lefte of Ammorreis, Etheis, and Fereseis, and Eueys, and Jebuseys, that ben not of the sones of Israel,
21 the sones of these hethen men, that dwelliden in the lond, that is, whiche the sones of Israel myyten not distrye.
22 Sotheli kyng Salomon ordeynede not ony man of the sones of Israel to serue, but thei weren men werriours, and mynystris of him, and princes, and dukis, and prefectis of his chares and horsis.
23 Sotheli fyue hundrid and fifti `souereynes weren princes ouer alle the werkis of Salomon, whiche princes hadden the puple suget, and comaundiden to werkis ordeyned.
24 Sotheli the douyter of Farao stiede fro the citee of Dauid in to hir hows, `which hows Salomon hadde bildid to hir; thanne he bildide Mello.
25 Also Salomon offride in thre tymes bi alle yeeris brent sacrifices and pesible sacrifices, on the auter which he hadde bildid to the Lord; and he brente encense bifor the Lord, and the temple was performed.
26 Also king Salomon made `o schip in Asiongaber, which is bisidis Haila, in the brenke of the Reed sea, and in the lond of Idumee.
27 And Iram sente in that schip hise seruauntis, schipmen, and kunnynge of the see, with the seruauntis of Salomon;
28 and whanne thei hadden come in to Ophir, thei brouyten fro thennus gold of foure hundrid and twenti talentis to kyng Salomon.

CAP 10
1 But also the queen of Saba, whanne the fame of Salomon was herd, cam in the name of the Lord to tempte hym in derk and douti questiouns.
2 And sche entride with myche felouschipe and richessis in to Jerusalem, and with camels berynge swete smellynge thingis, and gold greetli with out noumbre, and preciouse stoonys; and sche cam to king Salomon, and spak to hym alle thingis whiche sche hadde in hir herte.
3 And Salomon tauyte hir alle wordis whiche sche hadde put forth; no word was, that myyte be hid fro the kyng, and which he answeryde not to hir.
4 Forsothe the queen of Saba siy al the wisdom of Salomon, and the hows which he hadde bildid,
5 and the metis of his table, and the dwellyng places of hise seruauntis, and the ordris of mynystris, and the clothis of hem, and the boteleris, and the brent sacrifices whiche he offride in the hows of the Lord; and sche hadde no more spirite.
6 And sche seide to the kyng, The word is trewe, which Y herde in my lond, of thi wordis, and of thi wisdom;
7 and Y bileuyde not to men tellynge to me, til Y my silf cam, and siy with myn iyen, and preuede that the half part was not teld to me; thi wisdom is more and thi werkis, than the tale which Y herde.
8 Thi men ben blessid, and thi seruauntis ben blessid, these that stonden bifor thee euere, and heren thi wisdom.
9 Blessid be thi Lord God, whom thou plesedist, and hath set thee on the trone of Israel; for the Lord louyde Israel with outen ende, and hath ordeynyd thee kyng, that thou schuldist do doom and riytfulnesse.
10 Therfor sche yaf to the kyng sixe score talentis of gold, and ful many swete smellynge thingis, and precious stoonus; so many swete smellynge thingis weren no more brouyt, as tho which the queen of Saba yaf to kyng Salomon.
11 But also the schip of Hiram, that brouyte gold fro Ophir, brouyte fro Ophir ful many trees of tyme, and preciouse stoonys.
12 And kyng Salomon made of the trees of tyme vndir settyngis of the hows of the Lord, and of the kyngis hows, and harpis, and sitols to syngeris; siche trees of tyme weren not brouyt nether seyn, til in to present dai.
13 Sotheli kyng Salomon yaf to the queen of Saba alle thingis whiche sche wolde, and axide of hym, outakun these thingis whiche he hadde youe to hir bi the kyngis yifte wilfuli; and sche turnede ayen, and yede in to hir lond with hir seruauntis.
14 Forsothe the weyte of gold, that was offrid to Salomon bi ech yeer, was of sixe hundrid and sixe and sixti talentis of gold,
15 outakun that which men that weren on the talagis, `that is, rentis for thingis borun aboute in the lond, and marchauntis, and alle men sillynge scheeldys, and alle the kyngis of Arabie, and dukis of erthe yauen.
16 And kyng Salomon made two hundrid scheeldis of pureste gold; he yaf sixe hundrid siclis of gold in to the platis of oo scheeld;
17 and he made thre hundrid of bokeleris of preued gold; thre hundrid talentis of gold clothiden o bokeler. And the kyng puttide tho in the hows of the forest of Lyban.
18 Also kyng Salomon made a greet trone of yuer, and clothide it with ful fyn gold;
19 which trone hadde sixe grees; and the hiynesse of the trone was round in the hynderere part; and tweine hondis on this side and on that side, holdynge the seete, and twei lyouns stoden bisidis ech hond;
20 and twelue litil liouns stondynge on sixe grees on this side and on that side; siche a werk was not maad in alle rewmes.
21 But also alle the vessels, of which kyng Salomon drank, weren of gold, and alle the purtenaunce of the hows of the forest of Liban was of pureste gold; siluer was not, nether it was arettid of ony prijs in the daies of Salomon.
22 For the schip of `the kyng wente onys bi thre yeer with the schip of Hiram in to Tharsis, and brouyte fro thennus gold, and siluer, and teeth of olifauntis, and apis, and pokokis.
23 Therfor kyng Salomon was magnified aboue alle kyngis of erthe in richessis and wisdom.
24 And al erthe desiride to se the cheer of Salomon, to here the wisdom of him, which wisdom God hadde youe in his herte.
25 And alle men brouyten yiftis to hym, vessels of gold, and of siluer, clothis, and armeris of batel, and swete smellynge thingis, and horsis, and mulis, bi ech yeer.
26 And Salomon gaderide togidere charis, and knyytis; and a thousinde and foure hundrid charis weren maad to hym, and twelue thousynde `of knyytis; and he disposide hem bi strengthid citees, and with the kyng in Jerusalem.
27 And he made, that so greet aboundaunce of siluer was in Jerusalem, how greet was also of stoonys; and he yaf the multitude of cedris as sicomoris, that growen in feeldy places.
28 And the horsis of Salomon weren led out of Egipt, and of Coa; for the marchauntis of the kyng bouyten of Coa, and brouyten for prijs ordeyned.
29 Forsothe a chare yede out of Egipt for sixe hundrid siclis of siluer, and an hors for an hundrid and fifti siclis; and bi this maner alle the kyngis of Etheis and of Sirye seelden horsis.

CAP 11
1 Forsothe kyng Salomon louyde brennyngli many alien wymmen, and the douytir of Pharao, and wymmen of Moab, and Amonytis, and Ydumeis, and Sydoneis, and Etheis;
2 of the folkis of whiche the Lord seide to the sones of Israel, Ye schulen not entre to tho folkis, nether ony of hem schulen entre to you; for most certeynli thei schulen turne awei youre hertis, that ye sue the goddis of hem. Therfor kyng Salomon was couplid to these wymmen, bi moost brennyng loue.
3 And wyues as queenys weren seuene hundrid to hym, and thre hundrid secundarie wyues; and the wymmen turneden awey his herte.
4 And whanne he was thanne eld, his herte was bischrewid bi wymmen, that he suede alien goddis; and his herte was not perfit with his Lord God, as the herte of Dauid, his fadir, `was perfit.
5 But Salomon worschipide Astartes
1, the goddesse of Sidoneis, and Chamos, the god of Moabitis, and Moloch, the idol of Amonytis;
6 and Salomon dide that, that pleside not bifor the Lord, and he fillide not that he suede the Lord, as Dauid, his fadir, dide.
7 Thanne Salomon bildide a temple to Chamos, the idol of Moab, in the hil which is ayens Jerusalem, and to Moloch, the idol of the sones of Amon.
8 And bi this maner he dide to alle hise alien wyues, that brenten encencis, and offriden to her goddis.
9 Therfor the Lord was wrooth to Salomon, for his soule was turned awei fro the Lord God of Israel; that apperide to Salomon the secounde tyme,
10 and comaundide of this word, that he schulde not sue alien goddis; and he kepte not tho thingis, whiche the Lord comaundide to hym.
11 Therfor the Lord seide to Salomon, For thou haddist this thing anentis thee, and keptist not my couenaunt, and myn heestis, whiche Y comaundide to thee, Y schal breke, and Y schal departe thi rewme, and Y schal yyue it to thi seruaunt.
12 Netheles Y schal not do in thi daies, for Dauid, thi fadir; Y schal kitte it fro the hond of thi sone;
13 nether Y schal do a wey al the rewme, but Y schal yyue o lynage to thi sone, for Dauid, my seruaunt, and for Jerusalem, which Y chess.
14 Forsothe the Lord reiside to Solomon an aduersarie, Adad Ydumey, of the kyngis seed, that was in Edom.
15 For whanne Dauid was in Ydumee, and Joab, the prince of chyualrie, hadde stied to birie hem that weren slayn, and he hadde slayn ech male kynde in Ydumee;
16 for Joab, and al Israel dwelliden there bi sixe monethis, til thei killiden ech male kynde in Ydumee; Adad hym silf fledde,
17 and men of Ydumee, of `the seruauntis of his fadir, with hym, that he schulde entre in to Egipt; sotheli Adad was a litil child.
18 And whanne thei hadden rise fro Madian, thei camen in to Faran; and thei token with hem men of Faran, and entriden in to Egipt, to Pharao, kyng of Egipt; which Farao yaf an hows to hym, and ordeynede metis, and assignede lond.
19 And Adad foond grace bifor Farao greetli, in so myche that Farao yaf to hym a wijf, the sister of his wijf, sister of the queen, of Taphnes.
20 And the sistir of Taphnes gendrid to hym a sone, Genebath; and Taphnes nurschide hym in the hows of Farao; and Genebath dwellide bifor Farao, with hise sones.
21 And whanne Adad hadde herd in Egipt, that Dauid slepte with hise fadris, and that Joab, the prince of chyualrie, was deed, he seide to Farao, Suffre thou me, that Y go in to my lond.
22 And Farao seide to hym, For of what thing hast thou nede at me, that thou sekist to go to thi lond? And he answeride, Of no thing; but Y biseche thee, that thou `delyuere me.
23 Also God reiside an aduersarie to Salomon, Rason, sone of Eliadam, that fledde Adadezer, kyng of Soba, his lord;
24 and gaderide men ayens hym, and was maad the prince of theuys, whanne Dauid killide hem; and thei yeden to Damask, and dwelliden there; and thei maden hym kyng in Damask.
25 And he was aduersarie of Israel in alle the daies of Salomon; and this is the yuel of Adad, and the hatrede ayens Israel; and he regnede in Sirie.
26 Also Jeroboam, sone of Nabath, of Effraym of Saredera, the seruaunt of Salomon, of which Jeroboam, a womman widewe, Serua bi name, was modir, reisyde hond ayens the kyng.
27 And this was cause of rebelte ayens the kyng; for Salomon bildide Mello, and made euene the swolowe of the citee of Dauid, his fadir.
28 Forsothe Jeroboam was a miyti man and strong; and Salomon siy the yong wexynge man of good kynrede, and witti in thingis to be doon, and Salomon made hym `prefect, ether souereyn, on the tributis of al the hows of Joseph.
29 Therfor it was doon in that tyme, that Jeroboam yede out of Jerusalem; and Ahias of Sylo, a profete, hilid with a newe mentil, foond hym in the weie; sotheli thei tweyne weren oneli in the feeld.
30 And Ahias took his newe mentil, with which he was hilid, and kittide in to twelue partis;
31 and seide to Jeroboam, Take to thee ten kyttyngis; for the Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, Lo! Y schal kytte the rewme fro the hond of Salomon, and Y schal yyue to thee ten lynagis;
32 forsothe o lynage schal dwelle to hym, for Dauid, my seruaunt, and for Jerusalem, the citee which Y chees of alle the lynagis of Israel;
33 this kittyng schal be; for Salomon forsook me, and worschipide Astartes, goddesse of Sidoneis, and Chamos, the god of Moab, and Moloch, the god of the sones of Amon; and yede not in my weies, that he dide riytwisnesse bifor me, and myn heestis, and my domes, as Dauid, his fadir, dide.
34 And Y schal not take awey al the rewme fro `his hond, but Y schal putte hym duyk in alle the daies of his lijf, for Dauid, my seruaunt, whom Y chees, which Dauid kepte myn heestis, and my comaundementis.
35 Sotheli Y schal take awey the rewme fro the hond of `his sone, and Y schal yyue ten lynagis to thee;
36 forsothe Y schal yyue o lynage to `his sone, that a lanterne dwelle to Dauid, my seruaunt, in alle daies bifor me in Jerusalem, the citee which Y chees, that my name schulde be there.
37 Forsothe Y schal take thee, and thou schalt regne on alle thingis whiche thi soule desirith, and thou schalt be kyng on Israel.
38 Therfor if thou schalt here alle thingis whiche Y schal comaunde to thee, and if thou schalt go in my weies, and if thou schalt do that, that is riytful bifore me, and if thou schalt kepe my comaundementis, and myn heestis, as Dauid, my seruaunt, dide, Y schal be with thee, and Y schal bilde a feithful hows to thee, as Y bildide an hows to Dauid, and Y schal yyue Israel to thee;
39 and Y schal turmente the seed of Dauid on this thing, netheles not in alle daies.
40 Therfor Salomon wolde sle Jeroboam, which roos, and fledde in to Egipt, to Susach, kyng of Egipt; and he was in Egipt `til to the deeth of Salomon.
41 Forsothe the residue of the wordis of Salomon, and alle thingis whiche he dide, and his wisdom, lo! alle thingis ben writun in the book of wordis of daies of Salomon.
42 Sotheli the daies bi whiche Salomon regnede in Jerusalem on al Israel, ben fourti yeer.
43 And Salomon slepte with hise fadris, and was biriede in the citee of Dauid, his fadir; and Roboam, his sone, regnede for hym.

CAP 12
1 Forsothe Roboam cam in to Sichem; for al Israel was gaderid thidur to make hym kyng.
2 `And sotheli Jeroboam, sone of Nabath, whanne he was yit in Egipt, and fledde fro the face of kyng Salomon, turnede ayen fro Egipt, for the deeth of Salomon was herd;
3 and thei senten, and clepiden hym. Therfor Jeroboam cam, and al the multitude of Israel, and thei spaken to Roboam,
4 and seiden, Thi fadir puttide hardeste yok on vs, therfor abate thou a litil now of the hardest comaundement of thi fadir, and of the greuousiste yok which he puttide on vs, and we schulen serue to thee.
5 Which Roboam seide to hem, Go ye `til to the thridde dai, and turne ye ayen to me.
6 And whanne the puple hadde go, kyng Roboam took counsel with the eldere men, that stoden bifor Salomon, his fadir, while he lyuyde yit; and Roboam seide, What counsel yyue ye to me, that Y answere to the puple?
7 Whiche seiden to hym, If thou obeiest to dai to this puple, and seruest this puple, and yyuest stide to her axyng, and spekist to hem liyte wordis, thei schulen be seruauntis to thee in alle daies.
8 Which Roboam forsook the counsel of elde men, which thei yauen to hym, and took yonge men, that weren nurschid with hym, and stoden nyy him;
9 and he seide to hem, What counsel yyue ye to me, that Y answere to this puple, that seiden to me, Make thou esyere the yok which thi fadir puttide on vs?
10 And the yonge men, that weren nurschid with hym, seiden to hym, Thus speke thou to this puple, that spaken to thee, and seiden, Thi fadir made greuouse oure yok, releeue thou vs; thus thou schalt speke to hem, My leest fyngur is grettere than the bak of my fader;
11 and now my fadir puttide on you a greuouse yok, forsothe Y schal adde on youre yok; my fadir beet you with scourgis, forsothe Y schal bete you with scorpiouns.
12 Therfor Jeroboam, and al the puple, cam to Roboam, in the thridde dai, as the kyng spak, seiynge, Turne ye ayen to me in the thridde dai.
13 And the kyng answeride harde thingis to the puple, while the counsel of eldere men was forsakun, which thei hadden youe to hym;
14 and he spak to hem bi the counsel of yonge men, and seide, My fadir made greuouse youre yok, forsothe Y schal adde to youre yok; my fadir beet you with scourgis, forsothe Y schal bete you with scorpiouns.
15 And the kyng assentide not to the puple, for the Lord hadde turned awey, `ether hadde wlatid hym, that the Lord schulde reise his word, which he hadde spoke in the hond of Ahias of Silo to Jeroboam, sone of Nabath.
16 Therfor the puple siy, that the kyng nolde here hem; and the puple answeride to the kyng, and seide, What part is to vs in Dauid, ether what eritage in the sone of Ysay? Israel, turne thou ayen in to thi tabernaclis; now, Dauid, se thou thin hows. And Israel yede in to hise tabernaclis.
17 Forsothe Roboam regnede on the sones of Israel, whiche euere dwelliden in the citees of Juda.
18 Therfore kyng Roboam sente Adhuram, that was on the tributis; and al the puple of Israel stonyde hym, and he was deed.
19 Forsothe kyng Roboam stiede hastili on the chare, and fledde in to Jerusalem; and Israel departide fro the hows of Dauid, til in to present dai.
20 Forsothe it was doon, whanne al Israel hadde herd that Jeroboam turnede ayen, thei senten, and clepiden hym, whanne the cumpany was gaderid togidere, and thei maden hym kyng on al Israel; and no man suede the hows of Dauid, outakun the lynage aloone of Juda.
21 Forsothe Roboam cam to Jerusalem, and gaderide al the hows of Juda, and the lynage of Beniamyn, an hundrid and fourescore thousynde of chosun men and weriours, that thei schulden fiyte ayens the hows of Israel, and schulden brynge ayen the rewme to Roboam, sone of Solomon.
22 Forsothe the word of God was made to Semeia, the man of God, and seide,
23 Speke thou to Roboam, sone of Salomon, the kyng of Juda, and to al the hows of Juda and of Beniamyn, and to the residue of the puple, and seie thou, The Lord seith thes thingis,
24 Ye schulen not stie, nether ye schulen fiyte ayens youre britheren, the sones of Israel; `a man turne ayen in to his hows, for this word is doon of me. Thei herden the word of the Lord, and thei turneden ayen fro the iurney, as the Lord comaundide to hem.
25 Forsothe Jeroboam bildide Sichem, in the hil of Effraym, and dwellide there; and he yede out fro thennus, and bildide Phanuel.
26 And Jeroboam seide in his herte, Now the rewme schal turne ayen to the hows of Dauid,
27 if this puple stieth to Jerusalem, that it make sacrifices in the hows of the Lord in Jerusalem; and the herte of this puple schal turne to her lord, Roboam, kyng of Juda; and thei schulen sle me, and schulen turne ayen to hym.
28 And by counsel thouyt out, he made tweyne goldun caluys, and seide to hem, Nyle ye stie more in to Jerusalem; Israel, lo! thi goddis, that ledden thee out of the lond of Egipt.
29 And he settide oon in Bethel, and the tother in Dan.
30 And this word was maad to Israel in to synne; for the puple yede til in to Dan, to worschipe the calf.
31 And Jeroboam made templis in hiye placis, and `he made preestis of the laste men of the puple, that weren not of the sones of Leuy.
32 And he ordeynede a solempne dai in the eiythe monethe, in the fiftenthe dai of the monethe, bi the licnesse of solempnyte which was halewid in Juda. And he stiede, and made in lijk maner an auter in Bethel, that he schulde offre to the calues, whiche he hadde maad; and he ordeynede in Bethel preestis of the hiye places, whiche he hadde maad.
33 And he styede on the auter, which he hadde bildid in Bethel, in the fiftenthe day of the eiythe monethe, which he hadde feyned of his herte; and he made solempnyte to the sones of Israel, and he stiede on the auter, that he schulde brenne encence.

CAP 13
1 And lo! a man of God cam fro Juda, bi the word of the Lord, in to Bethel, while Jeroboam stood on the auter, `and castide encence.
2 And `the man of God criede ayens the auter, bi the word of the Lord, and seide, Auter! auter! the Lord seith these thingis, Lo! a sone, Josias by name, shal be borun to the hows of Dauid; and he schal offre on thee the preestis of hiye thingis, that brennen now encensis yn thee, and he schal brenne the bonys of men on thee.
3 And he yaf a signe in that dai, `and seide, This schal be `the signe that the Lord spak, Lo! the auter schal be kit, and the aische which is `there ynne, schal be sched out.
4 And whanne the kyng hadde herd the word of the man of God, which word he hadde cried ayens the auter in Bethel, the kyng helde forth his hond fro the auter, and seide, Take ye hym. And his hond driede, which he hadde holde forth, and he myyte not drawe it ayen to hym silf.
5 Also the auter was kit, and the aische was sched out of the auter, bi the signe which the man of God bifor seide, in the word of the Lord.
6 And the kyng seide to the man of God, Biseche thou the face of thi Lord God, and preie thou for me, that myn hond be restorid to me. And the man of God preiede the face of God; and the hond of the king turnede ayen to hym, and it was maad as it was bifore.
7 Sotheli the kyng spak to the man of God, Come thou hoom with me, that thou ete, and Y schal yyue yiftis to thee.
8 And the man of God seide to the kyng, Thouy thou schalt yyue to me the half part of thin hows, Y schal not come with thee, nether Y schal ete breed, nether Y schal drynke watir in this place;
9 `for so it is comaundid to me bi the word of the Lord, comaundinge, Thou schalt not ete breed, nether thou schalt drynke water, nether thou schalt turne ayen bi the weie bi which thou camest.
10 Therfor he yede bi another weie, and turnede not ayen bi the weie, bi which he cam in to Bethel.
11 Forsothe sum elde profete dwellide in Bethel, to whom hise sones camen, and telden to hym alle the werkis whiche the man of God hadde do in that dai in Bethel; and thei telden to her fader the wordis whiche he spak to the kyng.
12 And the fadir of hem seide to hem, Bi what weie yede he? Hise sones schewiden to hym the weie, bi which the man of God yede, that cam fro Juda.
13 And he seide to hise sones, Sadle ye an asse to me. And whanne thei hadden sadlid,
14 he stiede, and yede after the man of God, and foond hym sittyng vndur a terebynte. And he seide to the man of God, Whether thou art the man of God, that camest fro Juda? He answeride, Y am.
15 And he seide to hym, Come thou with me hoom, that thou ete breed.
16 And he seide, Y may not turne ayen, nether come with thee, nether Y schal ete breed, nether Y schal drynke water in this place;
17 for the Lord spak to me in the word of the Lord, and seide, Thou schalt not ete breed, and thou schalt not drynke water there, nether thou schalt turne ayen bi the weie bi which thou yedist.
18 Which seide to hym, And Y am a profete lijk thee; and an aungel spak to me bi the word of the Lord, and seide, Lede ayen hym in to thin hows, that he ete breed, and drynke watir. He disseyuede the man of God,
19 and brouyte him ayen with hym. Therfor he ete breed in his hows, and drank watir.
20 And whanne he sat at the table, the word of the Lord was maad to the prophete that brouyte hym ayen;
21 and he criede to the man of God that cam fro Juda, and seide, The Lord seith these thingis, For thou obeidist not to the mouth of the Lord, and keptist not the comaundement which thi Lord God comaundide to thee,
22 and thou turnedist ayen, and etist breed, and drankist watir in the place in which Y comaundide to thee, that thou schuldist not ete breed, nether schuldist drynke watir, thi deed bodi schal not be borun in to the sepulcre of thi fadris.
23 And whanne he hadde ete and drunke, the prophete, whom he hadde brouyt ayen, sadlide his asse.
24 And whanne he hadde go, a lioun foond hym in the weye, and killide hym. And his deed bodi was cast forth in the weie; sotheli the asse stood bisydis hym, and the lioun stood bisidis the deed bodi.
25 And lo! men passynge sien the deed bodi cast forth in the weye, and the lyoun stondynge bisidis the deed bodi; and thei camen, and pupplischiden in the citee, in which thilke eeld prophete dwellide.
26 And whanne thilke prophete, that brouyte hym ayen fro the weye, hadde herd this, he seide, It is the man of God, that was vnobedient to the mouth of God; and the Lord bitook hym to the lioun, that brak hym, and killide hym, bi the word of the Lord which he spak to hym.
27 And he seide to hise sones, Sadle ye an asse to me.
28 And whanne thei hadden sadlid, and he hadde go, he foond his deed bodi cast forth in the weie, and the asse and the lioun stondinge bisidis the deed bodi; and the lioun eet not the deed bodi, nether hirtide the asse.
29 Therfor the profete took the deed bodi of the man of God, and puttide it on the asse; and he turnede ayen, and brouyte it in to the cyte of the eeld prophete, that he schulde biweile hym.
30 And he puttide his deed bodi in his sepulcre, and thei biweiliden him, Alas! alas! my brother!
31 And whanne thei hadden biweilid hym, he seide to hise sones, Whanne Y schal be deed, birie ye me in the sepulcre, in which the man of God is biried; putte ye my bonys bisidis hise bonys.
32 For sotheli the word schal come, which he bifor seide in the word of the Lord, ayens the auter which is in Bethel, and ayens alle the templis of hiy placis, that ben in the citees of Samarie. After these wordis Jeroboam turnede not ayen fro his werste weie, but ayenward of the laste puplis he made preestis of hiye places; who euer wolde, fillide his hond, and he was maad preest of hiy placis.
33 And for this cause the hows of Jeroboam synnede, and it was distried, and doon awey fro the face of erthe.

CAP 14
1 In that tyme Abia, sone of Jeroboam, was sijk.
2 And Jeroboam seide to his wijf, Rise thou, and chaunge clothing, that thou be not knowun, that thou art the wijf of Jeroboam; and go thou in to Silo, where Ahia, the prophete, is, which spak to me, that Y schulde regne on this puple.
3 Also take thou in the hond ten looues, and a cake, and a vessil of hony, and go thou to hym; for he schal schewe to thee, what schal bifalle to this child.
4 The wijf of Jeroboam dide as he seide, and sche roos, and yede in to Silo, and cam in to the hows of Ahia; and he miyte not se, for hise iyen dasewiden for eelde.
5 Forsothe the Lord seide to Ahia, Lo! the wijf of Jeroboam entrith, that sche counsele thee on hir sone, which is sijk; thou schalt speke these and these thingis to hir. Therfor whanne sche hadde entrid, and hadde feyned hir silf to be that `womman which sche was not,
6 Ahia herde the soune of the feet of hir entrynge bi the dore, and he seide, Entre thou, the wijf of Jeroboam; whi feynest thou thee to bee an other womman? Forsothe Y am sent an hard messanger to thee.
7 Go thou, and seie to Jeroboam, The Lord God of Israel seith these thingis, For Y enhaunside thee fro the myddis of the puple, and Y yaf thee duyk on my puple Israel,
8 and Y kittide the rewme of the hows of Dauid, and Y yaf it to thee, and thou were not as my seruaunt Dauid, that kepte myn heestis, and suede me in al his herte, and dide that that was plesaunt in my siyt;
9 but thou wrouytist yuel, ouer alle men that weren bifore thee, and madist to thee alien goddis, and wellid to gidere, that thou schuldist excite me to wrathfulnesse, sotheli thou hast cast forth me bihyndis thi bak.
10 Therfor lo! Y schal brynge in yuels on the hows of Jeroboam, and Y schal smyte of Jeroboam `til to a pissere to the wal, and prisoned, and the laste in Israel; and Y schal clense the relikis of the hows of Jeroboam, as dung is wont to be clensid `til to the purete, `ether clennesse;
11 sotheli doggis schulen ete hem, that schulen die of the hows of Jeroboam in citee; forsothe briddis of the eyr schulen deuoure hem, that schulen die in the feeld; for the Lord spak.
12 Therfor rise thou, and go in to thin hows; and in thilke entryng of thi feet in to the citee the child schal die.
13 And al Israel schal biweile him, and schal birie; for this child aloone of Jeroboam schal be borun in to sepulcre, for a good word is foundun on hym of the Lord God of Israel, in the hows of Jeroboam.
14 Forsothe the Lord schal ordeyne to hym a kyng on Israel, that schal smyte the hows of Jeroboam, in this dai and in this tyme;
15 and the Lord God of Israel schal smyte, as a reed in the water is wont to be mouyd; and he schal drawe out Israel fro this good lond, which he yaf to her fadris, and he schal wyndewe hem ouer the flood, for thei maden to hem woodis, that thei schulden terre the Lord to ire.
16 And the Lord God schal bitake Israel to hise enemyes, for the synnes of Jeroboam, that synnede, and made Israel to do synne.
17 Therfor the wijf of Jeroboam roos, and yede, and cam in to Thersa; whanne sche entride in to the threschfold of the hows, the child was deed.
18 And thei birieden hym; and al Israel biweilide hym, bi the word of the Lord, which he spak in the hoond of his seruaunt, Ahia the prophet.
19 Forsothe, lo! the residue of wordis of Jeroboam, how he fauyt, and how he regnede, ben writun in the book of wordis of the daies of kyngis of Israel.
20 Forsothe the daies, in whiche Jeroboam regnede, ben two and twenti yeer; and Jeroboam slepte with hise fadris, and Nadab, his sone, regnede for hym.
21 Forsothe Roboam, the sone of Salomon, regnede in Juda; Roboam was of oon and fourti yeer, whanne he bigan to regne, and he regnede seuentene yeer in Jerusalem, the citee which the Lord chees of alle the lynagis of Israel, that he schulde sette his name there. Sotheli the name of his moder was Naama Amanyte.
22 And Juda dide yuel bifor the Lord, and thei terriden hym to ire on alle thingis, whiche her fadris diden in her synnes, bi whiche thei synneden.
23 For also thei bildiden to hem silf auters, and ymagis, and wodis, on eche hiy hil, and vndur ech tree ful of bowis.
24 But also `men of wymmens condiciouns weren in the lond, and thei diden alle abhominaciouns of hethene men, whiche the Lord al to-brak bifor the face of the sones of Israel.
25 Forsothe in the fifthe yeer of the rewme of Roboam, Sesach, the kyng of Egipt, styede in to Jerusalem;
26 and he took the tresouris of the hows of the Lord, and the kyngis tresouris, and he rauischide alle thingis; also `he rauischide the goldun scheeldis, whiche Salomon made.
27 For whiche kyng Roboam made brasun scheeldis, and yaf tho in the hondis of duykis of scheeld makeris, and of hem that wakiden bifor the dore of the hows of the Lord.
28 And whanne the kyng entride in to the hows of the Lord, thei that hadden office to go bifore, baren tho, and baren ayen to the place of armer of scheeld makeris.
29 Forsothe, lo! the residue of wordis of Roboam, and alle thingis whiche he dide, ben writun in the book of wordis of daies of kyngis of Juda.
30 And batel was bitwixe Roboam and Jeroboam, in alle daies.
31 And Roboam slepte with hise fadris, and was biried with hem in the citee of Dauid. Forsothe the name of his modir was Naama Amanyte; and Abia, his sone, regnede for hym.

1 Therfor in the eiytenthe yeer of the rewme of Jeroboam, sone of Nabath, Abia regnede on Juda.
2 Thre yeer he regnede in Jerusalem; the name of his modir was Maacha, douyter of Abessalon.
3 And he yede in alle the synnes of his fadir, which he dide bifor hym; and his herte was not perfit with his Lord God, as the herte of Dauid, his fadir, `was perfit.
4 But for Dauid his Lord God yaf to hym a lanterne in Jerusalem, that he schulde reise his sone after hym, and that he schulde stonde in Jerusalem;
5 for Dauid hadde do riytfulnesse in the iyen of the Lord, and hadde not bowid fro alle thingis whiche the Lord hadde comaundid to him, in alle the daies of his lijf, outakun the word of Urie Ethei.
6 Netheles batel was bitwix Abia and Jeroboam, in al the tyme of his lijf.

11 And Asa dide riytfulnesse in the siyt of the Lord, as Dauid, his fadir, dide;
12 and he took awey fro the loond men of wymmens condiciouns, and he purgide alle the filthis of idols, whiche his fadris maden.
13 Ferthermore and he remouyde Maacha, his modir, that sche schulde not be princesse in the solempne thingis of Priapus, and in his wode which sche hadde halewid; and he distriede the denne of hym, and he brak the foulest symylacre, and brente in the stronde of Cedron;
14 sotheli he dide not awei hiy thingis; netheles the herte of Asa was perfit with hys Lord God, in alle hise daies.
15 And he brouyte in to the hous of the Lord tho thingis, whiche his fadir hadde halewid and auowid, siluer, and gold, and vessel.
16 Forsothe batel was bitwixe Asa and Baasa, kyng of Israel, in alle the daies of hem.
17 And Baasa, kyng of Israel, stiede in to Juda, and bildide Rama, that no man of the part of Aza, kyng of Juda, myyte go out, ether go yn.
18 Therfor Asa took al the siluer and gold, that lefte in the tresouris of the hows of the Lord, and in the tresouris of the kyngis hows, and yaf it in to the hondis of hise seruauntis; and sente to Benadab, sone of Tabrennon, sone of Ozion, the kyng of Sirie, that dwellide in Damask, and seide,

20 Benadab assentide to kyng Asa, and sente the princes of his oost in to the citees of Israel; and thei smytiden Ahion, and Dan, and Abel, the hows of Maacha, and al Cenoroth, that is, al the lond of Neptalym.
21 And whanne Baasa hadde herd this thing, he lefte to bilde Rama, and turnede ayen in to Thersa.
22 Forsothe kyng Asa sente message in to al Juda, and seide, No man be excusid. And thei token the stoonys of Rama, and the trees therof, bi whiche Baasa hadde bildid; and kyng Asa bildide of the same `stoonys and trees Gabaa of Beniamyn, and Maspha.

26 And he dide that, that was yuel in the siyt of the Lord, and he yede in the weies of his fadir, and in the synnes of hym, in whiche he made Israel to do synne.
27 Forsothe Baasa, the sone of Ahia, of the hows of Ysachar, settide tresoun to hym, and smoot him in Gebethon, which is a citee of Filisteis; sothely Nadab and al Israel bisegiden Gebethon.
28 Therfor Baasa killide hym, in the thridde yeer of Asa, king of Juda, and regnede for hym.

10 He roos, and yede in to Sarepta of Sidoneis; and whanne he hadde come to the yate of the citee, a womman widewe gaderynge stickis apperide to hym; and he clepide hir, and seide to hir, Yyue thou to me a litil of water in a vessel, that Y drynke.
11 And whanne sche yede to bringe, he criede bihynde hir bac, and seide, Y biseche, bringe thou to me also a mussel of breed in thin hond.
12 And sche answeride, Thi Lord God lyueth, for Y haue no breed, no but as myche of mele in a pot, as a fist may take, and a litil of oile in a vessel; lo! Y gadere twei stickis, that Y entre, and make it to me, and to my sone, that we ete and die.
13 And Elie seide to hir, Nyle thou drede, but go, and make as thou seidist; netheles make thou firste to me of that litil mele a litil loof, bakun vndur the aischis, and brynge thou to me; sotheli thou schalt make afterward to thee and to thi sone.
14 Forsothe the Lord God of Israel seith thes thingis, The pot of mele schal not faile, and the vessel of oile schal not be abatid, til to the dai in which the Lord schal yyue reyn on the face of erthe.
15 And sche yede, and dide bi the word of Elie; and he eet, and sche, and hir hows.
16 And fro that dai the pot of mele failide not, and the vessel of oile was not abatid, bi the word of the Lord, which he hadde spoke in the hond of Elie.
17 Forsothe it was doon aftir these wordis, the sone of a womman hosewijf was sijk, and the sijknesse was moost strong, so that breeth dwellide not in hym.
18 Therfor sche seide to Elie, What to me and to thee, thou man of God? Entridist thou to me, that my wickidnessis schulden be remembrid, and that thou schuldist sle my sone?
19 And Elie seide to hir, Yyue thi sone to me. And he took `that sone fro hir bosum, and bar in to the soler, where he dwellide; and he puttide hym on his bed.
20 And he criede to the Lord, and seide, My Lord God, whether thou hast turmentid also the widewe, at whom Y am susteyned in al maner, that thou killidist hir sone?
21 He sprad abrood hym silf, and mat on the child bi thre tymes; and he cryede to the Lord, and seide, My Lord God, Y biseche, the soule of this child turne ayen in to the entrailis of hym.
22 The Lord herde the vois of Elie, and the soule of the child turnede ayen with ynne hym, and he lyuede ayen.
23 And Elie took the child, and puttide hym doun of the soler in to the lower hows, and bitook him to his modir; and he seide to hir, Lo! thi sone lyueth.
24 And the womman seide to Elie, Now in this Y haue knowe, that thou art the man of God, and the word of God is soth in thi mouth.

CAP 18
1 Aftir many daies the word of the Lord was maad to Elie, in the thridde yeer, and seide, Go, and schewe thee to Achab, that Y yyue reyn on the face of erthe.
2 Therfor Elie yede to schewe hym silf to Achab; forsothe greet hungur was in Samarie.
3 And Achab clepide Abdie, dispendere, ether stiward, of his hows; forsothe Abdie dredde greetli the Lord God of Israel.
4 For whanne Jezabel killide the prophetis of the Lord, he took an hundrid prophetis, and hidde hem, bi fifties and fifties, in dennes, and fedde hem with breed and watir.
5 Therfor Achab seide to Abdie, Go thou in to the lond, to alle wellis of watris, and in to alle valeis, if in hap we moun fynde gras, and saue horsis and mulis; and werk beestis perische not outirli.
6 Therfor thei departiden the cuntreis to hem silf, that thei schulden cumpasse tho; Achab yede bi o weye, and Abdie yede bi another weie, `bi hym silf.
7 And whanne Abdie was in the weie, Elie mette hym; and whanne he hadde knowe Elie, he felde on his face, and seide, Whethir thou art my lord Elie?
8 To whom he answeride, Y am. And Elie seide, Go thou, and seie to thi lord, Elie is present.
9 And Abdie seide, What `synnede Y, for thou bitakist me in the hond of Achab, that he sle me?
10 Thi Lord God lyueth, for no folk ethir rewme is, whidur my lord, sekynge thee, sente not; and whanne alle men answeriden, He is not here, he chargide greetli alle rewmes and folkis, for thou were not foundun; and now thou seist to me,
11 Go, and seie to thi lord, Elie is present.
12 And whanne Y schal departe fro thee, the Spirit of the Lord schal bere thee awey in to a place which Y knowe not; and Y schal entre, and `Y schal telle to Achab, and he schal not fynde thee, and he schal sle me; forsothe thi seruaunt dredith the Lord fro his yong childhod.
13 Whether it is not schewid to thee, my lord, what Y dide, whanne Jesabel killide the prophetis of the Lord, that Y hidde of the prophetis of the Lord an hundrid men, bi fifty and bi fifti, in dennes, and Y fedde hem with breed and watir?
14 And now thou seist, Go, and seie to thi lord, Elie is present, that he sle me.
15 And Elie seide, The Lord of oostis lyueth, bifor whos siyt Y stonde, for to dai Y schal appere to hym.
16 Therfor Abdie yede in to the metyng of Achab, and schewide to hym; and Achab cam in to the meetyng of Elie.
17 And whanne he hadde seyn Elie, he seide, Whether thou art he, that disturblist Israel?
18 And he seide, Not Y disturble Israel, but thou, and the hows of thi fadir, whiche han forsake the comaundementis of the Lord, and sueden Baalym, `disturbliden Israel.
19 Netheles now sende thou, and gadere to me al Israel, in the hil of Carmele, and foure hundrid and fifti prophetis of Baal, and foure hundrid prophetis of woodis, that eten of the table of Jezabel.
20 Achab sente to alle the sones of Israel, and gaderide prophetis in the hil of Carmele.
21 Forsothe Elie neiyede to al the puple of Israel, and seide, Hou long halten ye in to twey partis? If the Lord is God, sue ye hym; forsothe if Baal is God, sue ye hym. And the puple answeride not o word to hym.
22 And Elie seide eft to the puple, Y dwellide aloone a prophete of the Lord; sotheli the prophetis of Baal ben foure hundrid and fifti, and the prophetis of woodis ben foure hundrid men.
23 Tweyne oxis be youun to us; and chese thei oon oxe, and thei schulen kitte in to gobetis, and schulen putte on trees, but putte thei not fier vndur; and Y schal make the tother oxe in to sacrifice, and Y schal putte on the trees, and Y schal not putte fier vnder.
24 Clepe ye the name of youre goddis, and Y schal clepe the name of my God; and the God that herith bi fier, be he God. And al the puple answeride, and seide, The resoun is best, `which resoun Elie spak.
25 Therfor Elie seide to the prophetis of Baal, Chese ye oon oxe to you, and make ye first, for ye ben the mo; and clepe ye the names of youre goddis, and putte ye not fier vnder.
26 And whanne thei hadden take the oxe, whom Elie yaf to hem, thei maden sacrifice, and clepiden the name of Baal, fro the morewtid `til to myddai, and seiden, Baal, here vs! And no vois was, nether ony that answerd; and thei skippiden ouer the auter, which thei hadden maad.
27 And whanne it was thanne myddai, Elie scornede hem, and seide, Crie ye with gretter vois, for Baal is youre god, and in hap he spekith with an other, ethir he is in a herborgerie, ether in weie, ether certis he slepith, that he be reisid.
28 Therfor thei crieden with greet vois, and thei kerueden hem silf with knyues and launcetis, bi her custom, til thei weren bisched with blood.
29 Sotheli after that mydday passide, and while thei prophesieden, the tyme cam, in which the sacrifice is wont to be offrid, nether vois was herd `of her goddis, nether ony answeride, nether perceyuede hem preiynge.
30 Elie seide to al the puple, Come ye to me. And whanne the puple cam to him, he arrayede the auter of the Lord, that was distried.
31 And he took twelue stonys, bi the noumbre of lynagis of sones of Jacob, to which Jacob the word of the Lord was maad, and seide, Israel schal be thi name.
32 And he bildide an auter of stonys, in the name of the Lord, and he made a ledyng to of watir, `ether a dich, as bi twei litle dichis in the cumpas of the auter.
33 And he dresside trees, and he departide the oxe bi membris, and puttide on the trees,
34 and seide, Fille ye foure pottis with watir, and schede ye on the brent sacrifice, and on the trees. And eft he seide, Also the secounde tyme do ye this. `And thei diden the secounde tyme. And he seide, Do ye the same thing the thridde tyme; and thei diden the thridde tyme.
35 And the watris runnen aboute the auter, and the dich of ledyng to `of watir was fillid.
36 And whanne the tyme was thanne, that the brent sacrifice schulde be offrid, Elye the prophete neiyede, and seide, Lord God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, schewe thou to dai that thou art God of Israel, and that Y am thi seruaunt, and haue do alle these wordis bi thi comaundement.
37 Lord, here thou me; Lord, here thou me; that this puple lerne, that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast conuertid eft the herte of hem.
38 Sotheli fier of the Lord felde doun, and deuouride brent sacrifice, and trees, and stonus, and lickide vp also the poudre, and the water that was in the `leding of water.
39 And whanne al the puple hadde seyn this, it felde in to his face, and seide, The Lord he is God; the Lord he is God.
40 And Elie seide to hem, Take ye the prophetis of Baal; not oon sotheli ascape of hem. And whanne thei hadden take hem, Elie ledde hem to the stronde of Cison, and killide hem there.
41 And Elie seide to Achab, Stie thou, ete, and drynke, for the sown of myche reyn is.
42 Achab stiede to ete and drynke; forsothe Elie stiede in to the hil of Carmele, and he settide lowli his face to the erthe, bitwixe hise knees;
43 and seide to his child, Stie thou, and biholde ayens the see. And whanne he hadde stied, and hadde biholde, he seide, No thing is. And eft Elie seide to hym, Turne thou ayen bi seuene tymes.
44 Sotheli in the seuenthe tyme, lo! a litil cloude as the step of a man stiede fro the see. And Elie seide, Stie thou, and seie to Achab, Ioyne thi chare, and go doun, lest the reyn byfor ocupie thee.
45 And whanne thei turneden hem hidur and thidur, lo! heuenes weren maad derk, and cloud, and wynd, and greet reyn was maad. Therfor Achab stiede, and yede in to Jezrael;
46 and the hond of the Lord was maad on Elie, and whanne the leendis weren gird, he ran bifor Achab, til he cam in to Jezrael.

CAP 19
1 Forsothe Achab telde to Jezabel alle thingis whiche Elie hadde do, and how he hadde slayn by swerd alle the prophetis of Baal.
2 And Jezabel sente a messanger to Elie, and seide, Goddis do these thingis to me, and adde these thingis, no but to morewe in this our Y schal putte thi lijf as the lijf of oon of hem.
3 Therfor Elie dredde, and roos, and yede whidur euer wille bar hym; and he cam in to Bersabe of Juda, and he lefte there his child;
4 and yede in to deseert, the weie of o dai. And whanne he cam, and sat vndir o iunypere tre, he axide to his soule, that he schulde die; and he seide, Lord, it suffisith to me, take my soule; for Y am not betere than my fadris.
5 And he castide forth hym silf, and slepte in the schadewe of the iunypere tree. And lo! the aungel of the Lord touchide hym, and seide to hym, Rise thou, and ete.
6 He bihelde, and, lo! at his heed was a loof bakun vndur aischis, and a vessel of watir. Therfor he ete, and drank, and slepte eft.
7 And the aungel of the Lord turnede ayen the secounde tyme, and touchide hym; and `the aungel seide to hym, Rise thou, and ete; for a greet weie is to thee.
8 And whanne he hadde rise, he ete, and drank; and he yede in the strengthe of that mete bi fourti dayes and fourti nyytis, `til to Oreb, the hil of God.
9 And whanne he hadde come thidur, he dwellide in a denne; and lo! the word of the Lord `was maad to him, and seide to hym, Elie, what doist thou here?
10 And he answeride, Bi feruent loue Y louede feruentli, for the Lord God of oostis; for the sones of Israel forsoken the couenaunt of the Lord; thei destrieden thin auters, and killiden bi swerd thi prophetis; and Y am left aloone, and thei seken my lijf, that thei do it awei.
11 And he seide to Elie, Go thou out, and stonde in the hil, bifor the Lord. And lo! the Lord passith, and a greet wynde, and strong, turnynge vpsodoun hillis, and al to brekinge stonys bifor the Lord; not in the wynde ys the Lord. And aftir the wynd is a stirynge; not in the stiryng is the Lord.
12 And aftir the stiryng is fier; not in the fier is the Lord. And aftir the fier is the issyng of thinne wynd; there is the Lord.
13 And whanne Elie hadde herd this, he hilide his face with a mentil, and he yede out, and stood in the dore of the denne. And a vois spak to hym, and seide, Elie, what doist thou here?
14 And he answeride, Bi feruent loue Y louede feruentli, for the Lord God of oostis; for the sones of Israel forsoken thi couenaunt; thei distrieden thin auteris, and thei killiden bi swerd thi prophetis; and Y am left aloone, and thei seken my lijf, that thei do it awey.
15 And the Lord seide to hym, Go, and turne ayen in to thi weie, bi the deseert, in to Damask; and whanne thou schalt come thidur, thou schalt anoynte Asahel kyng on Sirie;
16 and thou schalt anoynte kyng on Israel Hieu, the sone of Namsi; sotheli thou schalt anoynte prophete for thee, Elise, sone of Saphat, which is of Abelmeula.
17 And it schal be, who euer schal fle the swerd of Asahel, Hieu schal sle hym; and who euer schal fle the swerd of Hieu, Elise schal sle hym.
18 And Y schal leeue to me in Israel seuene thousynde of men, of whiche the knees ben not bowid bifor Baal, and ech mouth that worschipide not hym, and kisside hond.
19 Therfor Elie yede forth fro thennus, and foond Elise, sone of Saphat, erynge in twelue yockis of oxis; and he was oon in the twelue yockis of oxys, erynge. And whanne Elie hadde come to hym, Elie castide his mentil on hym.
20 Which ran anoon after Elie, whanne the oxis weren left, and seide, Y preie thee, kysse Y my fadir and my modir, and so Y schal sue thee. And Elie seide to hym, Go thou, and turne ayen, for Y haue do to thee that that was myn.
21 `Sotheli he turnede ayen fro Elie, and took tweine oxis, and killide hem; and with the plow of oxis he sethide the fleischis, and yaf to the puple, and thei eeten; and he roos, and yede, and suede Elie, and `mynystride to hym.

CAP 20
1 Forsothe Benadab, kyng of Sirye, gaderide al his oost, and two and thritti kyngis with hym, and horsis, and charis; and he stiede ayens Samarie, and fauyt, and bisegide it.
2 And he sente messangeris to Achab, kyng of Israel, in to the citee,
3 and seide, Benadab seith these thingis, Thi siluer and thi gold is myn, and thi wyues, and thi beste sones ben myn.
4 And the kyng of Israel answeride, Bi thi word, my lord the kyng, Y am thin, and alle my thingis `ben thine.
5 And the messangeris turneden ayen, and seiden, Benadab, that sente vs to thee, seith these thingis, Thou schalt yyue to me thi siluer, and thi gold, and thi wyues, and thi sones.
6 Therfor to morewe, in this same our, Y schal sende my seruauntis to thee, and thei schulen seke thin hows, and the hows of thi seruauntis; and thei schulen putte in her hondis, and take awey al thing that schal plese hem.
7 Forsothe the kyng of Israel clepide alle the eldere men of the lond, and seide, Perseyue ye, and se, that he settith tresoun to vs; for he sente to me for my wyues, and sones, and for siluer, and gold, and Y forsook not.
8 And alle the gretter men in birthe, and al the puple seiden to hym, Here thou not, nether assente thou to hym.
9 And he answeride to the messangeris of Benadab, Seie ye to my lord the kyng, Y schal do alle thingis, for whiche thou sentist in the bigynnyng to me, thi seruaunt; forsothe Y may not do this thing.
10 And the messangeris turneden ayen, and telden alle thingis to hym. Which sente ayen, and seide, Goddis do these thingis to me, and adde these thingis, if the dust of Samarie schal suffice to the fistis of al the puple that sueth me.
11 And the kyng of Israel answeride, and seide, Seie ye to hym, A gird man, `that is, he that goith to batel, haue not glorie euenli as a man vngird.
12 Forsothe it was doon, whanne Benadab hadde herd this word, he drank, and the kyngis, in schadewyng places; and he seide to hise seruauntis, Cumpasse ye the citee.
13 And thei cumpassiden it. And lo! o prophete neiyede to Acab, kyng of Israel, and seide to hym, The Lord God seith these thingis, Certis thou hast seyn al this multitude ful greet; lo! Y schal bitake it in to thin hond to dai, that thou wite that Y am the Lord.
14 And Achab seide, Bi whom? And he seide to Achab, The Lord seith these thingis, Bi the squyeris of the princes of prouynces. And Achab seide, Who schal bigynne to fiyte? And the prophete seide, Thou.
15 Therfor he noumbryde the children of the princes of prouynces, and he foond the noumbre of twei hundrid and two and thretti; and aftir hem he noumbride the puple, alle the sones of Israel, seuene thousynde.
16 And thei yeden out in myddai. Forsothe Benadab drank, and was drunkun in his schadewyng place, and two and thretti kyngis with hym, that camen to the help of hym.
17 Sotheli the children of princes of prouynces yeden out in the firste frount. Therfor Benadab sente men, whiche telden to hym, and seide, Men yeden out of Samarie.
18 And he seide, Whether thei comen for pees, take ye hem quyke; whether to fiyte, take ye hem quyke.
19 Therfor the children of prynces of prouynces yeden out,
20 and the residue oost suede; and ech smoot the man that cam ayens hym. And men of Sirie fledden, and Israel pursuede hem; also Benadab, kyng of Sirie, fledde on an hors with his kniytis.
21 Also the king of Israel yede out, and smoot horsis and charis, and he smoot Sirie with a ful greet veniaunce.
22 Forsothe a prophete neiyede to the kyng of Israel, and seide, Go thou, and be coumfortid, and wyte, and se, what thou schalt do; for the kyng of Sirie schal stie ayens thee in the yeer suynge.
23 Sotheli the seruauntis of the kyng of Sirie seiden to hym, The Goddis of hillis ben the Goddis of the sones of Israel, therfor thei ouercamen vs; but it is betere that we fiyte ayens hem in feeldi placis, and we schulen geet hem.
24 Therfor do thou this word; remoue thou alle kyngis fro thin oost, and sette thou princis for hem;
25 and restore thou the noumbre of knyytis, that felden of thine, and horsis bi the formere horsis, and restore thou charis, bi the charis whiche thou haddist bifore; and we schulen fiyte ayens hem in feeldy places, and thou schalt se, that we schulen gete hem. He bileuyde to the counsel of hem, and dide so.
26 Therfor after that the yeer hadde passid, Benadab noumbride men of Sirie, and he stiede in to Affech, to fiyte ayens Israel.
27 Forsothe the sones of Israel weren noumbrid; and whanne meetis weren takun, thei yeden forth euene ayens, and thei, as twey litle flockis of geet, settiden tentis ayens men of Sirie. Forsothe men of Sirie filliden the erthe.
28 And o prophete of God neiyede, and seide to the kyng of Israel, The Lord God seith these thingis, For men of Sirie seiden, God of hillis is the Lord of hem, and he is not God of valeis, Y schal yyue al this greet multitude in thin hond, and ye schulen wite that Y am the Lord.
29 In seuene daies these and thei dressiden scheltruns euene ayens; forsothe in the seuenthe dai the batel was joyned togidere, and the sones of Israel smytiden of men of Syrie an hundrid thousynde of foot men in o dai.
30 Forsothe thei that leften fledden in to the citee of Affech, and the wal felde doun on seuene and twenti thousynde of men that leften. Forsothe Benadab fledde, and entride in to the citee, in to a closet that was with ynne a closet;
31 and hise seruauntis seiden to him, We herden that the kyngis of the hows of Israel ben merciful, therfor putte we sackis in oure leendis, and cordis in oure heedis, and go we out to the kyng of Israel; in hap he schal saue oure lyues.
32 Thei girdiden her leendis with sackis, and puttiden coordis in her heedis, and thei camen to the kyng of Israel, and seiden to hym, Thi seruaunt Benadab seith, Y preye thee, lete `my soule lyue. And he seide, If Benadab lyueth yit, he is my brother.
33 Which thing the men of Sirie token for a graciouse word, and rauyschiden hastily the word of his mouth, and seiden, Thi brother Benadab lyueth. And Achab seide to hem, Go ye, and brynge ye hym to me. Therfor Benadab yede out to hym, and he reiside Benadab in to his chare.
34 `Which Benadab seide to hym, Y schal yelde the citees whiche my fadir took fro thi fadir, and make thou stretis to thee in Damask, as my fadir made in Samarie; and Y schal be boundun to pees, and Y schal departe fro thee. Therfor he made boond of pees, and delyuerede hym.
35 Thanne sum man of the sones of prophetis seide to his felowe, in the word of the Lord, Smyte thou me. And he nolde smyte.
36 To `whiche felowe he seide, For thou noldist here the vois of the Lord, lo! thou schalt go fro me, and a lioun schal smyte thee. And whanne he hadde go a litil fro hym, a lioun foond hym, and slowy hym.
37 But also the prophete foond another man, and he seide to that man, Smyte thou me. Which smoot him, and woundide him.
38 Therfor the prophete yede, and mette the kyng in the weie; and he chaungide his mouth and iyen, by sprynging of dust.
39 And whanne the kyng hadde passid, he criede to the kyng, and seide, Thi seruaunt yede out to fiyte anoon, and whanne o man hadde fledde, sum man brouyte hym to me, and seide, Kepe thou this man; and if he aschapith, thi lijf schal be for his lijf, ether thou schalt paye a talent of siluere.
40 Sotheli while Y was troblid, and turnede me hidur and thidur, sodeynly he apperide not. And the kyng of Israel seide to hym, This is thi doom which thou hast demed.
41 And anoon he wipide awey the dust fro his face, and the kyng of Israel knew him, that he was of the prophetis.
42 Which seide to the kyng, The Lord seith these thingis, For thou deliueridist fro thin hond a man worthi the deeth, thi lijf schal be for his lijf, and thi puple `schal be for his puple.
43 Therfor the kyng of Israel turnede ayen in to his hows, and dispiside to here, and cam wod in to Samarie.

CAP 21
1 Forsothe after these wordis, in that tyme, the vyner of Naboth of Jezrael, `that was in Jezrael, was bisidis the paleis of Achab, kyng of Samarye.
2 Therfor Achab spak to Naboth, and seide, Yyue thou to me the vyner, that Y make to me a gardyn of wortis, for it is nyy, and nyy myn hows; and Y schal yyue to thee a betere vyner for it; ethir if thou gessist it more profitable to thee, Y schall yyue the prijs of siluer, as myche as it is worth.
3 To whom Naboth answeride, The Lord be merciful to me, that Y yyue not to thee the eritage of my fadris.
4 Therfor Acab cam in to his hows, hauynge indignacioun, and gnastyng on the word which Naboth of Jezrael hadde spoke to him, and seide, Y schal not yyue to thee the eritage of my fadirs. And Achab castide doun him silf in to his bed, and turnede awei his face to the wal, and ete not breed.
5 Forsothe Jezabel, his wijf, entride to hym, and seide to hym, What is this thing, wherof thi soule is maad sory? and whi etist thou not breed?
6 Which answeride to hir, Y spak to Naboth of Jezrael, and Y seide to hym, Yyue thi vyner to me for money takun, ethir if it plesith thee, Y schal yyue to thee a betere vyner for it. And he seide, Y schal not yyue to thee my vyner.
7 Therfor Jezabel, his wijf, seide to hym, Thou art of greet auctorite, and thou gouernest wel Israel; rise thou, and ete breed, and be thou `pacient, ethir coumfortid; Y schal yyue to thee the vyner of Naboth of Jezrael.
8 Therfor sche wroot lettris in the name of Achab, and seelide tho with the ryng of hym; and sche sente to the grettere men in birthe, and to the beste men, that weren in the citee of hym, and dwelliden with Naboth.
9 Sotheli this was the sentence of the lettre; Preche ye fastyng, and make ye Naboth to sitte among the firste men of the puple;
10 and sende ye priueli twei men, the sones of Belial, ayens hym, and sey thei fals witnessyng, Naboth blesside God and the kyng; and lede ye out hym, and stoon ye him, and die he so.
11 Therfor hise citeseyns, the grettere men in birthe, and the beste men that dwelliden with hym in the citee, diden as Jezabel hadde comaundid, and as it was writun in the lettris, whiche sche hadde sent to hem.
12 Thei prechiden fastyng, and maden Naboth to sitte among the firste men of the puple;
13 and whanne twey men, sones of the deuel, weren brouyt, thei maden hem to sitte ayens hym, and thei, that is, as men of the deuel, seiden witnessyng ayens him bifor al the multitude, Naboth blesside God and the kyng; for which thing thei ledden hym with out the citee, and killiden him with stoonys.
14 And thei senten to Jezabel, and seiden, Naboth is stoonyd, and is deed.
15 Forsothe it was doon, whanne Jezabel hadde herd Naboth stonyd and deed, sche spak to Achab, Rise thou, take thou in possessioun the vyner of Naboth of Jezrael, which nolde assente to thee, and yyue it for money takun; for Naboth lyueth not, but is deed.
16 And whanne Achab hadde herd this, that is, Naboth deed, he roos, and yede doun in to the vyner of Naboth of Jezrael, to haue it in possessioun.
17 Therfor the word of the Lord was maad to Elie of Thesbi,
18 and seide, Rise thou, go doun in to the comyng of Achab, kyng of Israel, which is in Samarie; lo! he goith doun to the vyner of Naboth, that he haue it in possessioun.
19 And thou schalt speke to hym, and `thou schalt seie, The Lord God seith these thingis, Thou hast slayn, ferthermore and thou hast take in possessioun; and aftir these thingis thou schalt adde, In this place, wherynne doggis lickiden the blood of Naboth, thei schulen licke also thi blood.
20 And Achab seyde to Elie, Whether thou hast founde me thin enemy? Which Elie seide, Y haue founde, for thou art seeld that thou schuldist do yuel in the siyt of the Lord.
21 Therfor the Lord seith these thingis, Lo! Y schal brynge yn on thee yuel, and Y schal kitte awey thin hyndrere thingis, and Y schal sle of Achab a pissere to the wal, and prisoned, and the laste in Israel;
22 and Y schal yyue thin hows as the hows of Jeroboam, sone of Naboth, and as the hows of Baasa, sone of Ahia; for thou didist to excite me to wrathfulnesse, and madist Israel to do synne.
23 But also the Lord spak of Jezabel, and seide, Doggis schulen ete Jezabel in the feeld of Jesrael;
24 if Achab schal die in the citee, doggis schulen ete hym; sotheli if he schal die in the feeld, briddis of the eyr schulen ete hym.
25 Therfor noon other was sich as Achab, that was seeld to do yuel in the siyt of the Lord; for Jezabel his wijf excitide hym;
26 and he was maad abhomynable, in so myche that he suede the ydols that Ammorreis maden, which Ammorreis the Lord wastide fro the face of the sones of Israel.
27 Therfor whanne Achab hadde herd these wordis, he to-rente his cloth, and hilide his fleisch with an hayre, and he fastide, and slepte in a sak, and yede with the heed cast doun.
28 The word of the Lord was maad to Elie of Thesbi, and seide, Whethir thou hast not seyn Achab maad low bifor me? Therfor for he is maad low for the cause of me, Y schal not brynge yn yuel in hise daies, but in the daies of his sone Y schal bryng yn yuel to his hows.

CAP 22
1 Therfor thre yeeris passiden with out batel bitwixe Sirie and Israel.
2 Forsothe in the thridde yeer Josephat, king of Juda, yede doun to the kyng of Israel.
3 And the kyng of Israel seide to hise seruauntis, Witen ye not, that Ramoth of Galaad is oure, and we ben necgligent to take it fro the hoond of the kyng of Sirie?
4 And he seide to Josaphat, Whether thou schalt come with me to fiyte in to Ramoth of Galaad?
5 And Josophat seide to the kyng of Israel, As Y am, so and thou; my puple and thi puple ben oon; and my knyytis and thy knyytis `ben oon. And Josephat seide to the kyng of Israel, Y preie thee, axe thou to dai the word of the Lord.
6 Therfor the kyng of Israel gaderide prophetis aboute foure hundrid men, and he seide to hem, Owe Y to go in to Ramoth of Galaad to fiyte, ethir to reste? Whiche answeriden, Stie thou, and the Lord schal yyue it in the hond of the kyng.
7 Forsothe Josephat seide, Is not here ony profete of the Lord, that we axe bi hym?
8 And the kyng of Israel seide to Josephat, O man, Mychee, sone of Hiemla, is left, bi whom we moun axe the Lord; but Y hate hym, for he prophesieth not good to me, but yuel. To whome Josephat seide, Kyng, spek thou not so.
9 Therfor the kyng of Israel clepide summe chaumburleyn, and seide to hym, Haste thou to brynge Mychee, sone of Hiemla.
10 Forsothe the kyng of Israel, and Josephat, kyng of Juda, saten, ech in his trone, clothid with kyngis ournement, in the large hows bisidis the dore of the yate of Samarie; and alle prophetis prophecieden in the siyt of hem.
11 Also Sedechie, sone of Chanaan, made to hym silf hornes of yrun, and seide, The Lord God seith these thingis, With these thou schalt scatere Sirye, til thou do awei it.
12 And alle prophetis prophecieden in lijk maner, and seiden, Stye thou in to Ramoth of Galaad, and go thou with prosperite; and the Lord schal bitake thin enemyes in the hond of the kyng.
13 Sotheli the messanger, that yede to clepe Mychee, spak to hym, and seide, Lo! the wordis of prophetis with o mouth prechen goodis to the kyng; therfor thi word be lijk hem, and speke thou goodis.
14 To whom Mychee seide, The Lord lyueth, for what euer thing the Lord schal seie to me, Y schal speke this.
15 Therfor he cam to the kyng. And the kyng seide to hym, Mychee, owen we go in to Ramoth of Galaad to fiyte, ether ceesse? To which kyng he answeride, Stie thou, and go in prosperite; and the Lord schal bitake it `in to the hond of the kyng.
16 Forsothe the kyng seide to hym, Eft and eft Y coniure thee, that thou speke not to me, not but that that is soth in the name of the Lord.
17 And he seide, Y siy al Israel scaterid in the hillis, as scheep not hauynge a scheepherde; and the Lord seide, These han no lord, ech man turne ayen in to his hows in pees.
18 Therfor the kyng of Israel seide to Josaphat, Whethir Y seide not to thee, that he prophecieth not good to me, but euere yuel?
19 Sotheli thilke Mychee addide, and seide, Therefore here thou the word of the Lord; Y siy the Lord sittynge on his trone, and Y siy al the oost of heuene stondynge nyy hym, on the riyt side and on the left side.
20 And the Lord seide, Who schal disseyue Achab, kyng of Israel, that he stye, and falle in Ramoth of Galaad? And oon seide siche wordis, and another in anothir maner.
21 Sotheli a spirit yede out, and stood bifor the Lord, and seide, Y schal disseyue hym. To whom the Lord spak, In what thing?
22 And he seide, Y schal go out, and Y schal be a spirit of leesyng in the mouth of alle hise prophetis. And the Lord seide, Thou schalt disseyue, and schalt haue the maystry; go thou out, and do so.
23 Now therfor, lo! the Lord yaf a spirit of leesyng in the mouth of alle prophetis that ben here; and the Lord spak yuel ayens thee.
24 Forsothe Sedechie, sone of Canaan, neiyede, and smoot Mychee on the cheke, and seide, Whether the Spirit of the Lord forsook me, and spak to thee?
25 And Mychee seide, Thou schalt se in that dai, whanne thou schalt go in to closet with ynne closet, that thou be hid.
26 And the kyng of Israel seide, Take ye Mychee, and dwelle he at Amon, prince of the citee, and at Joas, the sone of Amalech;
27 and seie ye to hem, The kyng seith these thingis, Sende ye this man in to prisoun, and susteyne ye hym with breed of tribulacioun, and with watir of angwisch, til Y turne ayen in pees.
28 And Mychee seide, If thou schalt turne ayen in pees, the Lord spak not in me. And he seide, Here ye, alle puplis.
29 Therfor the kyng of Israel stiede, and Josaphat, kyng of Juda, in to Ramoth of Galaad.
30 Therfor the kyng of Israel seide to Josephat, Take thou armeris, and entre thou in to batel, and be thou clothid in thi clothis, that is, noble signes of the kyng. Certis the kyng of Israel chaungide hise clothing, and entride in to batel.
31 Sotheli the kyng of Sirie hadde comaundid to two and thritti princes of charis, and seide, Ye schulen not fiyte ayens ony man lesse, ethir more, no but ayens the kyng of Israel oonli.
32 Therfor whanne the princes of charis hadden seyn Josephat, thei suposiden that he was king of Israel, and bi feersnesse maad thei fouyten ayens hym.
33 And Josephat criede; and the princis of charis vndurstoden, that it was not the king of Israel, and thei ceessiden fro hym.
34 Sotheli sum man bente a bowe, and dresside an arowe in to vncerteyn, and bi hap he smoot the kyng of Israel bitwixe the lunge and the stomak. And the kyng seide to his charietere, Turne thin hond, and cast me out of the oost, for Y am woundid greuousli.
35 Therfor batel was ioyned in that dai, and the kyng of Israel stood in his chare ayens men of Sirie, and he was deed at euentid. Forsothe the blood of the wounde fletide doun in to the bothome of the chare.
36 And a criere sownede in al the oost, before that the sunne yede doun, and seide, Ech man turne ayen in to his citee, and in to his lond.
37 Forsothe the kyng was deed, and was borun in to Samarie; and thei birieden the kyng of Samarie.
38 And thei waischiden his chare in the cisterne of Samarie, and doggis lickiden his blood, and thei wayschiden the reynes, bi the word of the Lord whiche he hadde spoke.
39 Sotheli the residue of wordis of Achab, and alle thingis whiche he dide, and the hows of yuer which he bildide, and of alle citees whiche he bildide, whether these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Israel?
40 Therfor Achab slepte with hise fadris, and Ocozie, his sone, regnede for hym.
41 Forsothe Josephat, sone of Asa, bigan to regne on Juda in the fourthe yeer of Achab, kyng of Israel.
42 Josephat was of fyue and thretti yeer, whanne he bigan to regne, and he regnede fyue and twenti yeer in Jerusalem; the name of his modir was Azuba, douyter of Salai.
43 And he yede in al the weye of Asa, his fadir, and bowide not fro it; and he dide that, that was riytful in the siyt of the Lord.
44 Netheles he dide not awey hiy thingis, for yit the puple made sacrifice, and brente encense in hiy places.
45 And Josephat hadde pees with the king of Israel.
46 Sotheli the residue of wordis of Josephat, and the werkis and batels, whiche he dide, whethir these ben not writun in the book of wordis of daies of the kyngis of Juda?
47 But also he took awey fro the loond the relikis of men turned in to wymmens condiciouns, that leften in the daies of Aza, his fadir.
48 Nethir a kyng was ordeyned thanne in Edom.
49 Forsothe king Josephat made schippis in the see, that schulden seile in to Ophir for gold, and tho myyten not go, for thei weren brokun in Asiongaber.
50 Thanne Ocozie, sone of Achab, seide to Josephat, My seruauntis go with thine in schippis.
51 And Josephat nolde. And Josephat slepte with hise fadris, and was biried with hem in the citee of Dauid, his fadir; and Joram, his sone, regnede for hym.
52 Forsothe Ocozie, sone of Achab, bigan to regne on Israel, in Samarie, in the seuenetenthe yeer of Josephat, kyng of Juda; and Ocozie regnede on Israel twei yeer.
53 And he dide yuel in the siyt of the Lord, and yede in the wey of his fadir, and of his modir, and in the weie of Jeroboam, sone of Nabath, that made Israel to do synne.
54 And he seruyde Baal, and worschipide hym, and wraththide the Lord God of Israel, bi alle thingis whiche his fadir hadde do.
