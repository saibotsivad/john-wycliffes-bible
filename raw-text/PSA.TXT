
PSALM 1
1 Blessid is the man, that yede not in the councel of wickid men; and stood not in the weie of synneris, and sat not in the chaier of pestilence.
2 But his wille is in the lawe of the Lord; and he schal bithenke in the lawe of hym dai and nyyt.
3 And he schal be as a tree, which is plauntid bisidis the rennyngis of watris; which tre schal yyue his fruyt in his tyme. And his leef schal not falle doun; and alle thingis which euere he schal do schulen haue prosperite.
4 Not so wickid men, not so; but thei ben as dust, which the wynd castith awei fro the face of erthe.
5 Therfor wickid men risen not ayen in doom; nethir synneres in the councel of iust men.
6 For the Lord knowith the weie of iust men; and the weie of wickid men schal perische.

PSALM 2
1 Whi gnastiden with teeth hethene men; and puplis thouyten veyn thingis?
2 The kyngis of erthe stoden togidere; and princes camen togidere ayens the Lord, and ayens his Crist?
3 Breke we the bondis of hem; and cast we awei the yok of hem fro vs.
4 He that dwellith in heuenes schal scorne hem; and the Lord schal bimowe hem.
5 Thanne he schal speke to hem in his ire; and he schal disturble hem in his stronge veniaunce.
6 Forsothe Y am maad of hym a kyng on Syon, his hooli hil; prechynge his comaundement.
7 The Lord seide to me, Thou art my sone; Y haue gendrid thee to dai.
8 Axe thou of me, and Y schal yyue to thee hethene men thin eritage; and thi possessioun the termes of erthe.
9 Thou schalt gouerne hem in an yrun yerde; and thou schalt breke hem as the vessel of a pottere.
10 And now, ye kyngis, vndurstonde; ye that demen the erthe, be lerud.
11 Serue ye the Lord with drede; and make ye ful ioye to hym with tremblyng.
12 Take ye lore; lest the Lord be wrooth sumtyme, and lest ye perischen fro iust waie.
13 Whanne his `ire brenneth out in schort tyme; blessed ben alle thei, that tristen in hym.

PSALM 3
1 The title of the thridde salm. `The salm of Dauid, whanne he fledde fro the face of Absolon, his sone.
2 Lord, whi ben thei multiplied that disturblen me?
3 many men rysen ayens me. Many men seien of my soule, Noon helthe is to hym in his God.
4 But thou, Lord, art myn vptakere; my glorye, and enhaunsyng myn heed.
5 With my vois Y criede to the Lord; and he herde me fro his hooli hil.
6 I slepte, and `was quenchid, and Y roos vp; for the Lord resseyuede me.
7 I schal not drede thousyndis of puple cumpassynge me; Lord, rise thou vp; my God, make thou me saaf.
8 For thou hast smyte alle men beynge aduersaries to me with out cause; thou hast al to-broke the teeth of synneris.
9 Helthe is of the Lord; and thi blessyng, Lord, is on thi puple.

PSALM 4
1 The title of the fourthe salm. `To the victorie in orguns; the salm of Dauid.
2 Whanne Y inwardli clepid, God of my riytwisnesse herde me; in tribulacioun  thou hast alargid to me.
3 Haue thou mercy on me; and here thou my preier. Sones of men, hou long ben ye of heuy herte? whi louen ye vanite, and seken a leesyng?
4 And wite ye, that the Lord hath maad merueilous his hooli man; the Lord schal here me, whanne Y schal crye to hym.
5 Be ye wrothe, and nyle ye do synne; `and for tho thingis whiche ye seien in youre hertis and in youre beddis, be ye compunct.
6 Sacrifie ye `the sacrifice of riytfulnesse, and hope ye in the Lord; many seien, Who schewide goodis to vs?
7 Lord, the liyt of thi cheer is markid on vs; thou hast youe gladnesse in myn herte.
8 Thei ben multiplied of the fruit of whete, and of wyn; and of her oile.
9 In pees in the same thing; Y schal slepe, and take reste.
10 For thou, Lord; hast set me syngulerli in hope.

PSALM 5
1 The title of the fyuethe salm. To the ouercomere on the eritagis, the song of Dauid.
2 Lord, perseyue thou my wordis with eeris; vndurstonde thou my cry.
3 Mi kyng, and my God; yyue thou tent to the vois of my preier.
4 For, Lord, Y schal preie to thee; here thou eerly my vois.
5 Eerli Y schal stonde nyy thee, and Y schal se; for thou art God not willynge wickidnesse.
6 Nethir an yuel willid man schal dwelle bisidis thee; nethir vniust men schulen dwelle bifor thin iyen.
7 Thou hatist alle that worchen wickidnesse; thou schalt leese alle that speken leesyng. The Lord schal holde abhomynable a manquellere, and gileful man.
8 But, Lord, in the multitude of thi merci Y schal entre in to thin hows; Y schal worschipe to thin hooli temple in thi drede.
9 Lord, lede thou forth me in thi riytfulnesse for myn enemyes; dresse thou my weie in thi siyt.
10 For whi treuthe is not  in her mouth; her herte is veyn.
11 Her throte is an opyn sepulcre, thei diden gilefuli with her tungis; God, deme thou hem. Falle thei doun fro her thouytis, vp the multitude of her wickidnessis caste thou hem doun; for, Lord, thei han terrid thee to ire. And alle that hopen in thee, be glad; thei schulen make fulli ioye with outen ende, and thou schalt dwelle in hem.
12 And alle that louen thi name schulen haue glorie in thee;
13 for thou schalt blesse a iust man. Lord, thou hast corouned vs, as with the scheeld of thi good wille.

PSALM 6
1 The title of the sixte salm. To the ouercomere in salmes, the salm of Dauid, `on the eiythe.
2 Lord, repreue thou not me in thi stronge veniaunce; nether chastice thou me in thin ire.

4 And my soule is troblid greetli; but thou, Lord, hou long?
5 Lord, be thou conuertid, and delyuere my soule; make thou me saaf, for thi merci.
6 For noon is in deeth, which is myndful of thee; but in helle who schal knouleche to thee?
7 I traueilide in my weilyng, Y schal waische my bed bi ech nyyt; Y schal moiste, `ether make weet, my bedstre with my teeris.
8 Myn iye is disturblid of woodnesse; Y waxe eld among alle myn enemyes.
9 Alle ye that worchen wickidnesse, departe fro me; for the Lord hath herd the vois of my wepyng.
10 The Lord hath herd my bisechyng; the Lord hath resseyued my preier.
11 Alle my enemyes be aschamed, and be disturblid greetli; be thei turned togidere, and be thei aschamed ful swiftli.

PSALM 7
1 The title of the seuenthe salm. For the ignoraunce of Dauid, which he songe to the Lord on the wordis of Ethiopien, the sone of Gemyny.
2 Mi Lord God, Y haue hopid in thee; make thou me saaf fro alle that pursuen me, and delyuere thou me.
3 Lest ony tyme he as a lioun rauysche my soule; the while noon is that ayenbieth, nether that makith saaf.
4 Mi Lord God, if Y dide this thing, if wickidnesse is in myn hondis;
5 if Y `yeldide to men yeldynge to me yuels, falle Y `bi disseruyng voide fro myn enemyes;
6 myn enemy pursue my soule, and take, and defoule my lijf in erthe; and brynge my glorie in to dust.
7 Lord, rise thou vp in thin ire; and be thou reysid in the coostis of myn enemyes.
8 And, my Lord God, rise thou in the comaundement, which thou `hast comaundid; and the synagoge of puplis schal cumpasse thee.
9 And for this go thou ayen an hiy; the Lord demeth puplis. Lord, deme thou me bi my riytfulnesse; and bi myn innocence on me.
10 The wickidnesse of synneris be endid; and thou, God, sekyng the hertis and reynes, schalt dresse a iust man.
11 Mi iust help is of the Lord; that makith saaf riytful men in herte.
12 The Lord is a iust iuge, stronge and pacient; whether he is wrooth bi alle daies?
13 If ye ben `not conuertid, he schal florische his swerd; he hath bent his bouwe, and made it redi.
14 And therynne he hath maad redi the vessels of deth; he hath fulli maad his arewis with brennynge thingis.
15 Lo! he conseyuede sorewe; he peynfuli brouyte forth vnriytfulnesse, and childide wickidnesse.
16 He  openide a lake, and diggide it out; and he felde in to the dich which he made.
17 His sorewe schal be turned in to his heed; and his wickidnesse schal come doun in to his necke.
18 I schal knouleche to the Lord bi his riytfulnesse; and Y schal synge to the name of the hiyeste Lord.

PSALM 8
1 The title of the eiythe salm. To the ouercomere, for pressours, the salm of Dauid.
2 Lord, thou art oure Lord; thi name is ful wonderful in al erthe. For thi greet doyng is reisid, aboue heuenes.
3 Of the mouth of yonge children, not spekynge and soukynge mylk, thou madist perfitli heriyng, for thin enemyes; that thou destrie the enemy and avengere.
4 For Y schal se thin heuenes, the werkis of thi fyngris; the moone and sterris, whiche thou hast foundid.
5 What is a man, that thou art myndeful of hym; ethir the sone of a virgyn, for thou visitist hym?
6 Thou hast maad hym a litil lesse than aungels; thou hast corouned hym with glorie and onour,
7 and hast ordeyned hym aboue the werkis of thin hondis.
8 Thou hast maad suget alle thingis vndur hise feet; alle scheep and oxis, ferthermore and the beestis of the feeld;
9 the briddis of the eir, and the fischis of the see; that passen bi the pathis of the see.
10 Lord, `thou art oure Lord; thi name `is wondurful in al erthe.

PALM 9
1 The title of the nynthe salm. In to the ende, for the pryuytees of the sone, the salm of Dauid.
2 Lord, Y schal knouleche to thee in al myn herte; Y schal telle alle thi merueils.
3 Thou hiyeste, Y schal be glad, and Y schal be fulli ioieful in thee; Y schal synge to thi name.
4 For thou turnest myn enemy abac; thei schulen be maad feble,  and schulen perische fro thi face.
5 For thou hast maad my doom and my cause; thou, that demest riytfulnesse, `hast set on the trone.
6 Thou blamedist hethene men, and the wickid perischide; thou hast do awei the name of hem in to the world, and in to the world of world.
7 The swerdis of the enemy failiden in to the ende; and thou hast distried the citees of hem. The mynde of hem perischide with sown;
8 and the Lord dwellith with outen ende. He made redi his trone in doom; and he schal deme the world in equite,
9 he schal deme puplis in riytfulnesse.
10 And the Lord is maad refuyt, `ether help, `to a pore man; an helpere in couenable tymes in tribulacioun.
11 And thei, that knowen thi name, haue hope in thee; for thou, Lord, hast not forsake hem that seken thee.
12 Synge ye to the Lord, that dwellith in Syon; telle ye hise studyes among hethene men.
13 God foryetith not the cry of pore men; for he hath mynde, and sekith the blood of hem.
14 Lord, haue thou merci on me; se thou my mekenesse of myn enemyes.
15 Which enhaunsist me fro the yatis of deeth; that Y telle alle thi preisyngis in the yatis of the douyter of Syon.
16 Y schal `be fulli ioyeful in thin helthe; hethene men ben fast set in the perisching, which thei maden. In this snare, which thei hidden, the foot of hem is kauyt.
17 The Lord makynge domes schal be knowun; the synnere is takun in the werkis of hise hondis.
18 Synneris be turned togidere in to helle; alle folkis, that foryeten God.
19 For the foryetyng of a pore man schal not be in to the ende; the pacience of pore men schal not perische in to the ende.
20 Lord, rise thou vp, a man be not coumfortid; folkis be demyd in thi siyt.
21 Lord, ordeine thou a lawe makere on hem; wite folkis, that thei ben men.
1 Lord, whi hast thou go fer awei? thou dispisist `in couenable tymes in tribulacioun.
2 While the wickid is proud, the pore man is brent; thei ben taken in the counsels, bi whiche thei thenken.
3 Forwhi the synnere is preisid in the desiris of his soule; and the wickid is blessid.
4 The synnere `wraththide the Lord; vp the multitude of his ire he schal not seke.
5 God is not in his siyt; hise weies ben defoulid in al tyme. God, thi domes ben takun awei fro his face; he schal be lord of alle hise enemyes.
6 For he seide in his herte, Y schal not be moued, fro generacioun in to generacioun without yuel.
7 `Whos mouth is ful of cursyng, and of bitternesse, and of gyle; trauel and sorewe is vndur his tunge.
8 He sittith in aspies with ryche men in priuytees; to sle the innocent man.
9 Hise iyen biholden on a pore man; he settith aspies in hid place, as a lioun in his denne. He settith aspies, for to rauysche a pore man; for to rauysche a pore man, while he drawith the pore man.
10 In his snare he schal make meke the pore man; he schal bowe hym silf, and schal falle doun, whanne he hath be lord of pore men.
11 For he seide in his herte, God hath foryete; he hath turned awei his face, that he se not in to the ende.
12 Lord God, rise thou vp, and thin hond be enhaunsid; foryete thou not pore men.
13 For what thing terride the wickid man God to wraththe? for he seide in his herte, God schal not seke.
14 Thou seest, for thou biholdist trauel and sorewe; that thou take hem in to thin hondis. The pore man is left to thee; thou schalt be an helpere to the fadirles and modirles.
15 Al to-breke thou the arme of the synnere, and yuel willid; his synne schal be souyt, and it schal not be foundun.
16 The Lord schal regne with outen ende, and in to the world of world; folkis, ye  schulen perische fro the lond of hym.
17 The Lord hath herd the desir of pore men; thin eere hath herd the makyng redi of her herte.
18 To deme for the modirles `and meke; that a man `leie to no more to `magnyfie hym silf on erthe.

PSALM 10
1 The title of the tenthe salm. To the victorie of Dauid.
2 I triste in the Lord; hou seien ye to my soule, Passe thou ouere in to an hil, as a sparowe doith?
3 For lo! synneris han bent a bouwe; thei han maad redi her arowis in an arowe caas; `for to schete in derknesse riytful men in herte.
4 For thei han distryed, whom thou hast maad perfit; but what dide the riytful man?
5 The Lord is in his hooli temple; he is Lord, his seete is in heuene. Hise iyen biholden on a pore man; hise iyelidis axen the sones of men.
6 The Lord axith a iust man, and vnfeithful man; but he, that loueth wickidnesse, hatith his soule.
7 He schal reyne snaris on `synful men; fier, brymston, and the spirit of tempestis ben the part of the cuppe of hem.
8 For the Lord is riytful, and louede riytfulnessis; his cheer siy equite, `ethir euennesse.

PSALM 11
1 The title of the eleuenthe salm. To the victorie on the eiyte, the song of Dauid.
2 Lord, make thou me saaf, for the hooli failide; for treuthis ben maad litle fro the sones of men.
3 Thei spaken veyn thingis, ech man to hys neiybore; thei han gileful lippis, thei spaken in herte and herte.
4 The Lord destrie alle gileful lippis; and the greet spekynge tunge.
5 Whiche seiden, We schulen magnyfie oure tunge, our lippis ben of vs; who is oure lord?
6 For the  wretchednesse of nedy men, and for the weilyng of pore men; now Y schal ryse vp, seith the Lord. I schal sette inhelt he; Y schal do tristili in hym.
7 The spechis of the Lord ben chast spechis; siluer examynyd bi fier, preued fro erthe, purgid seuen fold.
8 Thou, Lord, schalt kepe vs; and thou `schalt kepe vs fro this generacioun with outen ende.
9 Wickid men goen in cumpas; bi thin hiynesse thou hast multiplied the sones of men.

PSALM 12
1 The title of the twelfthe salm. To the victorie of Dauid.
Lord, hou long foryetist thou me in to the ende? hou long turnest thou awei thi face fro me?
2 Hou long schal Y sette counsels in my soule; sorewe in my herte bi dai?
3 Hou long schal myn enemy be reisid on me?
4 My Lord God, biholde thou, and here thou me. Liytne thou myn iyen, lest ony tyme Y slepe in deth;
5 lest ony tyme myn enemye seie, Y hadde the maistri ayens hym. Thei, that troblen me, schulen haue ioie, if Y schal be stirid; forsothe Y hopide in thi merci.
6 Myn herte schal fulli haue ioie in thin helthe; Y schal synge to the Lord, that yyueth goodis to me, and Y schal seie salm to the name of the hiyeste Lord.

PSALM 13
1 The `title of the threttenthe salm. To the victorie of Dauid.
The vnwise man seide in his herte, God is not. Thei ben corrupt, and ben maad abhomynable in her studies; noon is that doith good, noon is til to oon.
2 The Lord bihelde fro heuene on the sones of men; that he se, if ony is vndurstondynge, ethir sekynge God.
3 Alle bowiden awei, togidere thei ben maad vnprofitable; noon is  that doth good, noon is `til to oon. The throte of hem is an open sepulcre, thei diden gilefuli with her tungis; the venym of snakis is vndur her lippis. Whos mouth is ful of cursyng and bittirnesse; her feet ben swift to schede out blood. Sorewe and cursidnesse is in the weies of hem, and thei knewen not the weie of pees; the drede of God is not bifor her iyen.
4 Whether alle men that worchen wickidnesse schulen not knowe; that deuowren my puple, as mete of breed?
5 Thei clepeden not the Lord; thei trembliden there for dreed, where was no drede;
6 for the Lord is in a riytful generacioun. Thou hast schent the counsel of a pore man; for the Lord is his hope.
7 Who schal yyue fro Syon helthe to Israel? Whanne the Lord hath turned awei the caitifte of his puple; Jacob schal `fulli be ioiful, and Israel schal be glad.

PSALM 14
1 Lord, who schal dwelle in thi tabernacle; ether who schal reste in thin hooli hil?
2 He that entrith with out wem; and worchith riytfulnesse.
3 Which spekith treuthe in his herte; which dide not gile in his tunge. Nethir dide yuel to his neiybore; and took not schenschip ayens hise neiyboris.
4 A wickid man is brouyt to nouyt in his siyt; but he glorifieth hem that dreden the Lord. Which swerith to his neiybore, and disseyueth not;
5 which yaf not his money to vsure; and took not yiftis on the innocent. He, that doith these thingis, schal not be moued with outen ende.

PSALM 15
1 The title of the fiuetenthe salm. `Of the meke and symple, the salm of Dauid. Lord, kepe thou me, for Y haue hopid in thee;
2 Y seide to the Lord, Thou art my God, for thou hast no nede of my goodis.
3 To the seyntis that ben in the lond of hym; he made wondurful alle my willis in hem.
4 The sikenessis of hem ben multiplied; aftirward thei hastiden. I schal not gadire togidere the conuenticulis, `ethir litle couentis, of hem of bloodis; and Y schal not be myndeful of her names bi my lippis.
5 The Lord is part of myn eritage, and of my passion; thou art, that schalt restore myn eritage to me.
6 Coordis felden to me in ful clere thingis; for myn eritage is ful cleer to me.
7 I schal blesse the Lord, that yaf vndurstondyng to me; ferthermore and my reynes blameden me `til to nyyt.
8 I purueide euere the Lord in my siyt; for he is on the riythalf to me, that Y be not moued.
9 For this thing myn herte was glad, and my tunge ioyede fulli; ferthermore and my fleisch schal reste in hope.
10 For thou schalt not forsake my soule in helle; nether thou schalt yyue thin hooli to se corrupcioun. Thou hast maad knowun to me the weies of lijf; thou schalt fille me of gladnesse with thi cheer; delityngis ben in thi riythalf `til in to the ende.

PSALM 16
1 The title of the sixtenthe salm. The preier of Dauid. Lord, here thou my riytfulnesse; biholde thou my preier. Perseuye thou with eeris my preier; not maad in gileful lippis.
2 Mi doom come `forth of thi cheer; thin iyen se equite.
3 Thou hast preued myn herte, and hast visitid in niyt; thou hast  examynyd me bi fier, and wickidnesse is not foundun in me.
4 That my mouth speke not the werkis of men; for the wordis of thi lippis Y haue kept harde weies.
5 Make thou perfit my goyngis in thi pathis; that my steppis be not moued.
6 I criede, for thou, God, herdist me; bowe doun thin eere to me, and here thou my wordis.
7 Make wondurful thi mercies; that makist saaf `men hopynge in thee.
8 Kepe thou me as the appil of the iye; fro `men ayenstondynge thi riyt hond. Keuere thou me vndur the schadewe of thi wyngis;
9 fro the face of vnpitouse men, that han turmentid me. Myn enemyes han cumpassid my soule;
10 thei han closide togidere her fatnesse; the mouth of hem spak pride.
11 Thei castiden me forth, and han cumpassid me now; thei ordeyneden to bowe doun her iyen in to erthe.
12 Thei, as a lioun maad redi to prey, han take me; and as the whelp of a lioun dwellynge in hid places.
13 Lord, rise thou vp, bifor come thou hym, and disseyue thou hym; delyuere thou my lijf fro the `vnpitouse,
14 delyuere thou thi swerd fro the enemyes of thin hond. Lord, departe thou hem fro a fewe men of `the lond in the lijf of hem; her wombe is fillid of thin hid thingis. Thei ben fillid with sones; and thei leften her relifis to her litle children.
15 But Y in riytfulnesse schal appere to thi siyt; Y schal be fillid, whanne thi glorie schal appere.

PSALM 17
1 The title of the seuenetenthe salm. To victorie, the word of the Lord to Dauid; which spak the wordis of this song, in the dai in which the Lord delyuerede hym fro the hond of alle hise enemyes, and fro the hond of Saul; and he seide:
2 Lord, my strengthe, Y schal loue thee; the Lord is my stidfastnesse, and my refuyt,  and mi deliuerere.
3 Mi God is myn helpere; and Y schal hope in to hym. My defendere, and the horn of myn helthe; and myn vptakere.
4 I schal preise, and ynwardli clepe the Lord; and Y schal be saaf fro myn enemyes.
5 The sorewis of deth cumpassiden me; and the strondis of wickidnesse disturbliden me.
6 The sorewis of helle cumpassiden me; the snaris of deeth `bifor ocupieden me.
7 In my tribulacioun Y inwardli clepide the Lord; and Y criede to my God. And he herde my vois fro his hooli temple; and my cry in his siyt entride in to hise eeris.
8 The erthe was mouede togidere, and tremblede togidere; the foundementis of hillis weren troblid togidere, and weren moued togidere; for he was wrooth to hem.
9 Smoke stiede in the ire of hym, and fier brente out fro his face; coolis weren kyndlid of hym.
10 He bowide doun heuenes, and cam doun; and derknesse was vndur hise feet.
11 And he stiede on cherubym, and flei; he fley ouer the pennes of wyndis.
12 And he settide derknesses his hidyng place, his tabernacle `in his cumpas; derk water was in the cloudes of the lowere eir.
13 Ful cleer cloudis passiden in his siyt; hail and the coolis of fier.
14 And the Lord thundrid fro heuene; and the hiyeste yaf his vois, hail and the coolis of fier `camen doun.
15 And he sente hise arowis, and distriede tho men; he multipliede leytis, and disturblide tho men.
16 And the wellis of watris apperiden; and the foundementis of the erthe weren schewid. Lord, of thi blamyng; of the brething of the spirit of thin ire.
17 He sente fro the hiyeste place, and took me; and he took me fro many watris.
18 He delyuerede me fro my strongeste enemyes; and fro hem that hatiden me, fro thei weren coumfortid on me.
19 Thei camen bifor me in the dai of my turment; and the Lord was maad my defendere.
20 And he ledde out me in to breede; he maad me saaf, for he wolde me.
21 And  the Lord schal yelde to me bi my riytfulnesse; and he schal yelde to me bi the clennesse of myn hondis.
22 For Y kepte the weies of the Lord; and Y dide not vnfeithfuli fro my God.
23 For alle hise domes ben in my siyt; and Y puttide not awei fro me hise riytfulnessis.
24 And Y schal be vnwemmed with hym; and Y schal kepe me fro my wickidnesse.
25 And the Lord schal yelde to me bi my riytfulnesse; and bi the clennesse of myn hondis in the siyt of hise iyen.
26 With the hooli, thou schalt be hooli; and with `a man innocent, thou schalt be innocent.
27 And with a chosun man, thou schalt be chosun; and with a weiward man, thou schalt be weiward.
28 For thou schalt make saaf a meke puple; and thou schalt make meke the iyen of proude men.
29 For thou, Lord, liytnest my lanterne; my God, liytne thou my derknessis.
30 For bi thee Y schal be delyuered fro temptacioun; and in my God Y schal `go ouer the wal.
31 Mi God, his weie is vndefoulid, the speches of the Lord ben examyned bi fier; he is defendere of alle men hopynge in hym.
32 For whi, who is God out takun the Lord? ethir who is God outakun oure God?
33 God that hath gird me with vertu; and hath set my weie vnwemmed.

2 Heuenes tellen out the glorie of God; and the firmament tellith the werkis of hise hondis.

4 No langagis ben, nether wordis; of whiche the voices of hem ben not herd.
5 The soun of hem yede out in to al erthe; and the wordis of hem `yeden out in to the endis of the world.
6 In the sunne he hath set his tabernacle; and he as a spouse comynge forth of his chaumbre.  He fulli ioyede, as a giaunt, to renne his weie;

9 The riytfulnessis of the Lord ben riytful, gladdynge hertis; the comaundement of the Lord is cleere, liytnynge iyen.
10 The hooli drede of the Lord dwellith in to world of world; the domes of the Lord ben trewe, iustified in to hem silf.

13 Who vndurstondith trespassis? make thou me cleene fro my priuy synnes;

11 Thou schalt leese the fruyt of hem fro erthe; and `thou schalt leese the seed of hem fro the sones of men.
12 For thei bowiden yuels ayens thee; thei thouyten counseils, whiche thei myyten not stablische.

3 Mi God, Y schal crye bi dai, and thou schalt not here; and bi nyyt, and not to vnwisdom to me.
4 Forsothe thou, the preisyng of Israel, dwellist in holynesse;
5 oure fadris hopiden in thee, thei hopiden, and thou delyueridist hem.
6 Thei crieden to thee, and thei weren maad saaf; thei hopiden in thee, and thei weren not schent.
7 But Y am a worm, and not man; the schenschip of men, and the outcastyng of the puple.
8 Alle men seynge me scorneden me; thei spaken with lippis, and stiriden the heed.
9 He hopide in the Lord, delyuere he hym; make he hym saaf, for he wole hym.
10 For thou it art that drowist me out of the wombe, thou art myn hope fro the tetis of my modir;
11 in to thee Y am cast forth fro the wombe. Fro the wombe of my modir thou art my God; departe thou not fro me.
12 For tribulacioun is next; for noon is that helpith.
13 Many calues cumpassiden me; fatte bolis bisegiden me.
14 Thei openyden her mouth on me; as doith a lioun rauyschynge and rorynge.
15 I am sched out as watir; and alle my boonys ben scaterid. Myn herte is maad, as wex fletynge abrood; in the myddis of my wombe.
16 Mi vertu driede as a tiyl stoon, and my tunge cleuede to my chekis; and thou hast brouyt forth me in to the dust of deth.
17 For many doggis cumpassiden me; the counsel of wickid men bisegide me. Thei delueden myn hondis and my feet;
18 thei noumbriden alle my boonys. Sotheli thei lokiden, and bihelden me;
19 thei departiden my clothis to hem silf, and thei senten lot on my cloth.
20 But thou, Lord, delaie not thin help fro me; biholde thou to my defence.
21 God, delyuere thou my lijf fro swerd; and delyuere thou myn oon aloone fro the hond of the dogge.
22 Make thou me saaf fro the mouth of a lioun; and my mekenesse fro the hornes of vnycornes.
23 I schal telle thi name to my britheren; Y schal preise thee in the myddis of the chirche.
24 Ye that dreden the Lord, herie hym; alle the seed of Jacob, glorifie ye hym.
25 Al the seed of Israel drede hym; for he forsook not, nethir dispiside the preier of a pore man. Nethir he turnede awei his face fro me; and whanne Y criede to hym, he herde me.
26 Mi preisyng is at thee in a greet chirche; Y schal yelde my vowis in the siyt of men dredynge hym.
27 Pore men schulen ete, and schulen be fillid, and thei schulen herie the Lord, that seken hym; the hertis of hem schulen lyue in to the world of world.
28 Alle the endis of erthe schulen bithenke; and schulen be conuertid to the Lord. And alle the meynees of hethene men; schulen worschipe in his siyt.
29 For the rewme is the Lordis; and he schal be Lord of hethene men.
30 Alle the fatte men of erthe eeten and worschipiden; alle men, that goen doun in to erthe, schulen falle doun in his siyt.
31 And my soule schal lyue to hym; and my seed schal serue him.
32 A generacioun to comyng schal be teld to the Lord; and heuenes schulen telle his riytfulnesse to the puple that schal be borun, whom the Lord made.

6 This is the generacioun of men sekynge hym; of men sekynge the face of God of Jacob.

12 Who is a man, that dredith the Lord? he ordeyneth to hym a lawe in the weie which he chees.
13 His soule schal dwelle in goodis; and his seed schal enerite the lond.
14 The Lord is a sadnesse to men dredynge hym; and his testament is, that it be schewid to hem.

9 And thou closidist not me togidere withynne the hondis of the enemy; thou hast sett my feet in a large place.
10 Lord, haue thou merci on me, for Y am troblid; myn iye is troblid in ire, my soule and my wombe `ben troblid.
11 For whi my lijf failide in sorewe; and my yeeris in weilynges. Mi vertu is maad feble in pouert; and my boonys ben disturblid.
12 Ouer alle myn enemyes Y am maad schenship greetli to my neiyboris; and drede to my knowun. Thei that sien me with outforth, fledden fro me; Y am youun to foryetyng,

4 For bi dai and nyyt thin `hond was maad greuouse on me; Y am turned in my wretchednesse, while the thorn is set in.
5 I made my synne knowun to thee; and Y hidde not my vnriytfulnesse. I seide, Y schal knouleche ayens me myn vnriytfulnesse to the Lord; and thou hast foryoue the wickidnesse of my synne.
6 For this thing ech hooli man schal preye to thee; in couenable tyme. Netheles in the greet flood of many watris;  tho schulen not neiye to thee.
7 Thou art my refuyt fro tribulacioun, that cumpasside me; thou, my fulli ioiyng, delyuere me fro hem that cumpassen me.
8 Y schal yyue vnderstondyng to thee, and Y schal teche thee; in this weie in which thou schalt go, Y schal make stidefast myn iyen on thee.
9 Nile ye be maad as an hors and mule; to whiche is noon vndurstondyng. Lord, constreyne thou the chekis of hem with a bernacle and bridil; that neiyen not to thee.
10 Many betyngis ben of the synnere; but merci schal cumpasse hym that hopith in the Lord.
11 Ye iust men, be glad, and make fulli ioie in the Lord; and alle ye riytful of herte, haue glorie.

2 Knouleche ye to the Lord in an harpe; synge ye to hym in a sautre of ten strengis.
3 Synge ye to hym a newe song; seie ye wel salm to hym in criyng.

7 And he gaderith togidere the watris of the see as in a bowge; and settith depe watris in tresours.
8 Al erthe drede the Lord; sotheli alle men enhabitynge the world ben mouyd of hym.
9 For he seide, and thingis weren maad; he comaundide, and thingis weren maad of nouyt.
10 The Lord distrieth the counsels of folkis, forsothe he repreueth the thouytis of puplis; and he repreueth the counsels of prynces.
11 But the counsel of the Lord dwellith with outen ende; the thouytis of his herte dwellen in generacioun and into generacioun.
12 Blessid is the folk, whose Lord is his God; the puple which he chees into eritage to hym silf.
13 The Lord bihelde fro heuene; he siy alle the sones of men.
14 Fro his dwellyng place maad redi bifor; he bihelde on alle men, that enhabiten the erthe.
15 Which made syngulerli the soules of hem; which vndurstondith all the werkis of hem.
16 A kyng is not sauyd bi myche vertu; and a giaunt schal not be sauyd in the mychilnesse of his vertu.
17 An hors is false to helthe; forsothe he schal not be sauyd in the habundaunce, `ether plentee, of his vertu.
18 Lo! the iyen of the Lord ben on men dredynge hym; and in hem that hopen on his merci.
19 That he delyuere her soules fro deth; and feede hem in hungur.
20 Oure soule suffreth the Lord; for he is oure helpere and defendere.
21 For oure herte schal be glad in him; and we schulen haue hope in his hooli name.
22 Lord, thi merci be maad on vs; as we hopiden in thee.

2 I schal blesse the Lord in al tyme; euere his heriyng is in my mouth.
3 Mi soule schal be preisid in the Lord; mylde men here, and be glad.
4 Magnyfie ye the Lord with me; and enhaunse we his name into it silf.
5 I souyte the Lord, and he herde me; and he delyueride me fro alle my tribulaciouns.
6 Neiye ye to him, and be ye liytned; and youre faces schulen not be schent.
7 This pore man criede, and the Lord herde hym; and sauyde hym fro alle hise tribulaciouns.
8 The aungel of the Lord sendith in the cumpas of men dredynge hym; and he schal delyuere hem.
9 Taaste ye, and se, for the Lord is swete; blessid is the man, that hopith in hym.
10 Alle ye hooli men of the Lord, drede  hym; for no nedynesse is to men dredynge hym.
11 Riche men weren nedi, and weren hungri; but men that seken the Lord schulen not faile of al good.
12 Come, ye sones, here ye me; Y schal teche you the drede of the Lord.
13 Who is a man, that wole lijf; loueth to se good daies?
14 Forbede thi tunge fro yuel; and thi lippis speke not gile.
15 Turne thou awei fro yuel, and do good; seke thou pees, and perfitli sue thou it.
16 The iyen of the Lord ben on iust men; and hise eeren ben to her preiers.
17 But the cheer of the Lord is on men doynge yuels; that he leese the mynde of hem fro erthe.
18 Just men cryeden, and the Lord herde hem; and delyueride hem fro alle her tribulaciouns.
19 The Lord is nyy hem that ben of troblid herte; and he schal saue meke men in spirit.
20 Many tribulaciouns ben of iust men; and the Lord schal delyuere hem fro alle these.
21 The Lord kepith alle the boonys of hem; oon of tho schal not be brokun.
22 The deth of synneris is werst; and thei that haten a iust man schulen trespasse.
23 The Lord schal ayenbie the soulis of hise seruauntis; and alle, that hopen in him, schulen not trespasse.

4 Thei that seken my lijf; be schent, and aschamed. Thei that thenken yuels to me; be turned awei bacward, and be schent.
5 Be thei maad as dust bifor the face of the wynd; and the aungel of  the Lord make hem streit.

3 For he dide gilefuli in the siyt of God; that his wickidnesse be foundun to hatrede.
4 The wordis of his mouth ben wickidnesse and gile, he nolde vndirstonde to do wel.
5 He thouyte wickidnesse in his bed, he stood nyy al weie not good; forsothe he hatide not malice.
6 Lord, thi merci is in heuene; and thi treuthe is `til to cloudis.
7 Thi riytfulnesse is as the hillis of God; thi domes ben myche depthe of watris. Lord, thou schalt saue men and beestis;

10 For the wel of life is at thee; and in thi liyt we schulen se liyt.

3 Hope thou in the Lord, and do thou goodnesse; and enhabite thou the lond, and thou schalt be fed with hise richessis.
4 Delite thou in the Lord; and he schal yyue to thee the axyngis of thin herte.
5 Schewe thi weie to the Lord; and hope thou in hym, and he schal do.
6 And he schal lede out thi riytfulnesse as liyt, and thi doom as myddai;
7 be thou suget to the Lord, and preye thou hym. Nile thou sue hym, that hath prosperite in his weie; a man doynge vnriytfulnessis.
8 Ceese thou of ire, and forsake woodnesse; nyle thou sue, that thou do wickidli.
9 For thei, that doen wickidli, schulen be distried; but thei that suffren the Lord, schulen enerite the lond.
10 And yit a litil, and a synnere schal not be; and thou schalt seke his place, and schalt not fynde.
11 But mylde men schulen enerite the lond; and schulen delite in the multitude of pees.
12 A synnere schal aspie a riytful man; and he schal gnaste with hise teeth on hym.
13 But the Lord schal scorne the synnere; for he biholdith that his day cometh.

15 Her swerd entre in to the herte of hem  silf; and her bouwe be brokun.
16 Betere is a litil thing to a iust man; than many richessis of synneris.
17 For the armes of synneris schal be al to-brokun; but the Lord confermeth iust men.
18 The Lord knowith the daies of vnwemmed; and her heritage schal be withouten ende.
19 Thei schulen not be schent in the yuel tyme, and thei schulen be fillid in the dayes of hungur;
20 for synneris schulen perische. Forsothe anoon as the enemyes of the Lord ben onourid, and enhaunsid; thei failynge schulen faile as smoke.
21 A synnere schal borewe, and schal not paie; but a iust man hath merci, and schal yyue.
22 For thei that blessen the Lord schulen enerite the lond; but thei that cursen hym schulen perische.
23 The goyng of a man schal be dressid anentis the Lord; and he schal wilne his weie.
24 Whanne he fallith, he schal not be hurtlid doun; for the Lord vndursettith his hond.
25 I was yongere, and sotheli Y wexide eld, and Y siy not a iust man forsakun; nethir his seed sekynge breed.

27 Bouwe thou awei fro yuel, and do good; and dwelle thou in to the world of world.
28 For the Lord loueth doom, and schal not forsake hise seyntis; thei schulen be kept with outen ende. Vniust men schulen be punyschid; and the seed of wickid men schal perische.
29 But iust men schulen enerite the lond; and schulen enabite theronne in to the world of world.
30 The mouth of a iust man schal bithenke wisdom; and his tunge schal speke doom.
31 The lawe of his God is in his herte; and hise steppis schulen not be disseyued.
32 A synnere biholdith a iust man; and sekith to sle hym.
33 But the Lord schal not forsake hym in hise hondis; nethir schal dampne hym, whanne it schal be demed ayens hym.
34 Abide thou  the Lord, and kepe thou his weie, and he schal enhaunse thee, that bi eritage thou take the lond; whanne synneris schulen perische, thou schalt se.
35 I siy a wickid man enhaunsid aboue; and reisid vp as the cedris of Liban.
36 And Y passide, and lo! he was not; Y souyte hym, and his place is not foundun.
37 Kepe thou innocence, and se equite; for tho ben relikis to a pesible man.
38 Forsothe vniust men schulen perische; the relifs of wickid men schulen perische togidere.
39 But the helthe of iust men is of the Lord; and he is her defendere in the tyme of tribulacioun.

5 For my wickidnessis ben goon ouer myn heed; as an heuy birthun, tho ben maad heuy on me.

5 The feersnesse of flood makith glad the citee of God; the hiyeste God hath halewid his tabernacle.
6 God in the myddis therof schal not be moued; God schal helpe it eerli in the grey morewtid.
7 Hethene men weren disturblid togidere, and rewmes weren bowid doun; God yaf his vois, the erthe was moued.

9 And he schal not yyue the prijs of raunsum of his soule; and he schal trauele with outen ende,
10 and he schal lyue yit in to the ende.
11 He schal not se perischyng, whanne he schal se wise men diynge; the vnwise man and fool schulen perische togidere. And thei schulen leeue her richessis to aliens;
12 and the sepulcris of hem ben the housis of hem with outen ende. The tabernaclis of hem ben in generacioun and generacioun; thei clepiden her names in her londis.
13 A man, whanne he was in honour, vndurstood not; he is comparisound to vnwise beestis, and he is maad lijk to tho.
14 This weie of hem is sclaundir to hem; and aftirward thei schulen plese togidere in her mouth.
15 As scheep thei ben set in helle; deth schal gnawe hem. And iust men schulen be lordis of hem in the morewtid; and the helpe of hem schal wexe eld in helle, for the glorie of hem.
16 Netheles God schal ayenbie my soule from the power of helle; whanne he schal take me.

18 For whanne he schal die, he schal not take alle thingis; and his glorie schal not go doun with him.
19 For his soule schal be blessid in his lijf; he schal knouleche to thee, whanne thou hast do wel to hym.
20 He schal entre til in to the generaciouns  of hise fadris; and til in to with outen ende he schal not se liyt.
21 A man, whanne he was in honour, vndurstood not; he is comparisound to vnwise beestis, and is maad lijk to tho.

3 God schal come opynli; oure God, and he schal not be stille. Fier schal brenne an hiye in his siyt; and a strong tempest in his cumpas.
4 He clepide heuene aboue; and the erthe, to deme his puple.
5 Gadere ye to hym hise seyntis; that ordeynen his testament aboue sacrifices.

8 I schal not repreue thee in thi sacrifices; and thi brent sacrifices ben euere bifor me.

10 For alle the wyelde beestis of wodis ben myne; werk beestis, and oxis in hillis.
11 I haue knowe alle the volatils of heuene; and the fairnesse of the feeld is with me.
12 If Y schal be hungry, Y schal not seie to thee; for the world and the fulnesse therof is myn.
13 Whether Y schal eete the fleischis of boolis? ethir schal Y drynke the blood of geet buckis?
14 Offre thou to God the sacrifice of heriyng; and yelde thin avowis to the hiyeste God.
15 And inwardli clepe thou me in the dai of tribulacioun; and Y schal delyuere thee, and thou schalt onoure me.
16 But God seide to the synnere, Whi tellist thou out my riytfulnessis; and takist my testament bi thi mouth?
17 Sotheli thou hatidist lore;  and hast cast awey my wordis bihynde.
18 If thou siyest a theef, thou `hast runne with hym; and thou settidist thi part with avowtreris.
19 Thi mouth was plenteuouse of malice; and thi tunge medlide togidere giles.
20 Thou sittynge spakist ayens thi brother, and thou settidist sclaundir ayens the sone of thi modir;
21 thou didist these thingis, and Y was stille. Thou gessidist wickidli, that Y schal be lijk thee; Y schal repreue thee, and Y schal sette ayens thi face.
22 Ye that foryeten God, vndurstonde these thingis; lest sum tyme he rauysche, and noon be that schal delyuere.

3 God, haue thou merci on me; bi thi greet merci. And bi the mychilnesse of thi merciful doyngis; do thou awei my wickidnesse.
4 More waische thou me fro my wickidnesse; and clense thou me fro my synne.
5 For Y knouleche my wickidnesse; and my synne is euere ayens me.
6 I haue synned to thee aloone, and Y haue do yuel bifor thee; that thou be iustified in thi wordis, and ouercome whanne thou art demed. For lo!
7 Y was conseyued in wickednessis; and my modir conceyuede me in synnes.
8 For lo! thou louedist treuthe; thou hast schewid to me the vncerteyn thingis, and pryuy thingis of thi wisdom.
9 Lord, sprenge thou me with ysope, and Y schal be clensid; waische thou me, and Y schal be maad whijt more than snow.
10 Yyue thou ioie, and gladnesse to myn heryng; and boonys maad meke  schulen ful out make ioye.
11 Turne awei thi face fro my synnes; and do awei alle my wickidnesses.
12 God, make thou a clene herte in me; and make thou newe a riytful spirit in my entrailis.
13 Caste thou me not awei fro thi face; and take thou not awei fro me thin hooli spirit.
14 Yiue thou to me the gladnesse of thyn helthe; and conferme thou me with the principal spirit.
15 I schal teche wickid men thi weies; and vnfeithful men schulen be conuertid to thee.
16 God, the God of myn helthe, delyuere thou me fro bloodis; and my tunge schal ioyfuli synge thi riytfulnesse.
17 Lord, `opene thou my lippis; and my mouth schal telle thi preysyng.
18 For if thou haddist wold sacrifice, Y hadde youe; treuli thou schalt not delite in brent sacrifices.
19 A sacrifice to God is a spirit troblid; God, thou schalt not dispise a contrit herte and `maad meke.
20 Lord, do thou benygneli in thi good wille to Syon; that the wallis of Jerusalem be bildid.
21 Thanne thou schalt take plesauntli the sacrifice of riytfulnesse, offryngis, and brent sacrifices; thanne thei schulen putte calues on thin auter.

3 What hast thou glorie in malice; which art miyti in wickidnesse?
4 Al dai thi tunge thouyte vnriytfulnesse; as a scharp rasour thou hast do gile.
5 Thou louedist malice more than benygnite; `thou louedist wickidnesse more than to speke equite.
6 Thou louedist alle wordis of casting doun; with a gileful tunge.
7 Therfor God schal distrie thee in to the ende, he schal drawe  thee out bi the roote, and he schal make thee to passe awei fro thi tabernacle; and thi roote fro the lond of lyuynge men.
8 Iust men schulen se, and schulen drede; and thei schulen leiye on hym, and thei schulen seie, Lo!

10 Forsothe Y, as a fruytful olyue tre in the hous of God; hopide in the merci of God with outen ende, and in to the world of world.

2 Thei ben `corrupt, and maad abhomynable in her wickidnessis; noon is that doith good.
3 God bihelde fro heuene on the sones of men; that he se, if `ony is vndurstondynge, ether sekynge God.
4 Alle boweden awei, thei ben maad vnprofitable togidre; noon is that doith good, ther is not til to oon.
5 Whether alle men, that worchen wickidnesse, schulen not wite; whiche deuouren my puple as the mete of breed?
6 Thei clepiden not God; there thei trembliden for drede, where no drede was. For God hath scaterid the boones of hem, that plesen men; thei ben schent, for God hath forsake hem.
7 Who schal yyue fro Syon helthe to Israel? whanne the Lord hath turned the caitifte of his puple, Jacob schal `ful out make ioie, and Israel schal be glad.

PSALM 53

4 God, here thou my preier; with eeris perseyue thou the wordis of my mouth.
5 For aliens han rise ayens me, and stronge men souyten my lijf; and thei settiden not God bifor her siyt.
6 For, lo! God helpith me; and the Lord is vptaker of my soule.
7 Turne thou awei yuelis to myn enemyes; and leese thou hem in thi treuthe.
8 Wilfuli Y schal make sacrifice to thee; and, Lord, Y schal knouleche to thi name, for it is good.
9 For thou delyueridist me fro al tribulacioun; and myn iye dispiside on myn enemyes.

1 The title of the foure and fiftithe salm. `In Ebreu thus, To victorie in orguns, the lernyng of Dauid. `In Jeroms translacioun thus, To the ouercomer in salmes of Dauid lernid.
2 God, here thou my preier, and dispise thou not my biseching;
3 yyue thou tent to me, and here thou me. I am sorewful in myn exercising; and Y am disturblid of the face of the enemye,
4 and of the tribulacioun of the synner. For thei bowiden wickidnessis in to me; and in ire thei weren diseseful to me.
5 Myn herte was disturblid in me; and the drede of deth felde on me.
6 Drede and trembling camen on me; and derknessis hiliden me.
7 And Y seide, Who schal yyue to me fetheris, as of a culuer; and Y schal fle, and schal take rest?
8 Lo! Y yede fer awei, and fledde; and Y dwellide in wildirnesse.
9 I abood hym, that made me saaf fro the litilnesse,  `ether drede, of spirit; and fro tempest.
10 Lord, caste thou doun, departe thou the tungis of hem; for Y siy wickidnesse and ayenseiyng in the citee.
11 Bi dai and nyyt wickidnesse schal cumpasse it on the wallis therof;
12 and trauel and vnriytfulnesse ben in the myddis therof. And vsure and gile failide not; fro the stretis therof.
13 For if myn enemye hadde cursid me; sotheli Y hadde suffride. And if he, that hatide me, hadde spoke greet thingis on me; in hap Y hadde hid me fro hym.
14 But thou art a man of o wille; my leeder, and my knowun.
15 Which tokist togidere swete meetis with me; we yeden with consent in the hous of God.
16 Deth come on hem; and go thei doun quyk in to helle. For weiwardnessis ben in the dwelling places of hem; in the myddis of hem.
17 But Y criede to thee, Lord; and the Lord sauede me.
18 In the euentid and morewtid and in myddai Y schal telle, and schewe; and he schal here my vois.
19 He schal ayenbie my soule in pees fro hem, that neiyen to me; for among manye thei weren with me.
20 God schal here; and he that is bifore the worldis schal make hem low. For chaungyng is not to hem, and thei dredden not God;
21 he holdith forth his hoond in yelding. Thei defouliden his testament,
22 the cheris therof weren departid fro ire; and his herte neiyede. The wordis therof weren softer than oyle; and tho ben dartis.
23 Caste thi cure on the Lord, and he schal fulli nurische thee; and he schal not yyue with outen ende flotering to a iust man.
24 But thou, God, schalt lede hem forth; in to the pit of deth. Menquelleris and gilours schulen not haue half her daies; but, Lord, Y schal hope in thee.

Dauid meke and symple made this salm, whanne Palesteyns helden hym in Geth.
2 God, haue thou merci on me, for a man hath defoulid me; al dai he impugnyde, and troublide me.
3 Myn enemyes defouliden me al dai; for manye fiyteris weren ayens me.
4 Of the hiynesse of dai Y schal drede; but God Y schal hope in thee.
5 In God Y schal preise my wordis; Y hopide in God, Y schal not drede what thing fleisch schal do to me.
6 Al dai thei cursiden my wordis; ayens me alle her thouytis weren in to yuel.
7 Thei schulen dwelle, and schulen hide; thei schulen aspie myn heele.

12 God, thin auowis ben in me; whiche Y schal yelde heriyngis to thee.

2 God, haue thou merci on me, haue thou merci on me; for my soule tristith in thee. And Y schal hope in the schadewe of thi wyngis; til wickidnesse passe.
3 I schal crye to God altherhiyeste; to God that dide wel to me.

6 God, be thou enhaunsid aboue heuenes; and thi glorie aboue al erthe.
7 Thei maden redi a snare to my feet; and thei greetly boweden my lijf. Thei delueden a diche bifore my face; and thei felden doun in to it.
8 God, myn herte is redi, myn herte is redi; Y schal singe, and Y schal seie salm.
9 Mi glorie, rise thou vp; sautrie and harpe, rise thou vp; Y schal rise vp eerli.
10 Lord, Y schal knouleche to thee among puplis; and Y schal seie salm among hethene men.

3 For in herte ye worchen wickidnesse in erthe; youre hondis maken redi vnriytfulnessis.
4 Synneris weren maad aliens fro the wombe; thei erriden fro the wombe, thei spaken false thingis.
5 Woodnesse is to hem, bi the licnesse of a serpent; as of a deef snake, and stoppynge hise eeris.
6 Which schal not here the vois of charmeris; and of a venym makere charmynge wiseli.
7 God schal al to-breke the teeth of hem in her mouth; the Lord schal breke togidere the greet teeth of liouns.
8 Thei schulen come to nouyt, as water rennynge awei; he bente his bouwe, til thei ben maad sijk.

4 And iust men eete, and make fulli ioye in the siyt of God; and delite thei in gladnesse.
5 Synge ye to God, seie ye salm to his name; make ye weie to hym, that stieth on the goyng doun, the Lord is name to hym. Make ye fulli ioye in his siyt, enemyes  schulen be disturblid fro the face of hym,
6 which is the fadir of fadirles and modirles children; and the iuge of widewis.
7 God is in his hooli place; God that makith men of o wille to dwelle in the hous. Which leedith out bi strengthe hem that ben boundun; in lijk maner hem that maken scharp, that dwellen in sepulcris.
8 God, whanne thou yedist out in the siyt of thi puple; whanne thou passidist forth in the desert.
9 The erthe was moued, for heuenes droppiden doun fro the face of God of Synay; fro the face of God of Israel.
10 God, thou schalt departe wilful reyn to thin eritage, and it was sijk; but thou madist it parfit.
11 Thi beestis schulen dwelle therynne; God, thou hast maad redi in thi swetnesse to the pore man.
12 The Lord schal yyue a word; to hem that prechen the gospel with myche vertu.
13 The kyngis of vertues ben maad loued of the derlyng; and to the fairnesse of the hous to departe spuylis.
14 If ye slepen among the myddil of eritagis, the fetheris of the culuer ben of siluer; and the hyndrere thingis of the bak therof ben in the shynyng of gold.
15 While the king of heuene demeth kyngis theronne, thei schulen be maad whitter then snow in Selmon;
16 the hille of God is a fat hille. The cruddid hil is a fat hil;
17 wherto bileuen ye falsli, cruddid hillis? The hil in which it plesith wel God to dwelle ther ynne; for the Lord schal dwelle `in to the ende.
18 The chare of God is manyfoold with ten thousynde, a thousynde of hem that ben glad; the Lord was in hem, in Syna, in the hooli.
19 Thou stiedist an hiy, thou tokist caitiftee; thou resseyuedist yiftis among men. For whi thou tokist hem that bileueden not; for to dwelle in the Lord God.
20 Blessid be the Lord ech dai; the God of oure heelthis schal make an eesie wei to vs.
21 Oure God is God to make men saaf; and outgoyng fro deeth is of the Lord God.
22 Netheles God schal breke the heedis of  hise enemyes; the cop of the heere of hem that goen in her trespassis.
23 The Lord seide, Y schal turne fro Basan; Y schal turne in to the depthe of the see.
24 That thi foot be deppid in blood; the tunge of thi doggis be dippid in blood of the enemyes of hym.
25 God, thei sien thi goyngis yn; the goyngis yn of my God, of my king, which is in the hooli.
26 Prynces ioyned with syngeris camen bifore; in the myddil of yonge dameselis syngynge in tympans.
27 In chirchis blesse ye God; blesse ye the Lord fro the wellis of Israel.
28 There Beniamyn, a yonge man; in the rauyschyng of mynde. The princis of Juda weren the duykis of hem; the princis of Zabulon, the princis of Neptalym.
29 God, comaunde thou to thi vertu; God, conferme thou this thing, which thou hast wrouyt in vs.
30 Fro thi temple, which is in Jerusalem; kyngis schulen offre yiftis to thee.
31 Blame thou the wielde beestis of the reheed, the gaderyng togidere of bolis is among the kien of puplis; that thei exclude hem that ben preuyd bi siluer. Distrie thou folkis that wolen batels,
32 legatis schulen come fro Egipt; Ethiopie schal come bifore the hondis therof to God.
33 Rewmes of the erthe, synge ye to God; seie ye salm to the Lord.
34 Singe ye to God; that stiede on the heuene of heuene at the eest. Lo! he schal yyue to his vois the vois of vertu, yyue ye glorie to God on Israel;

4 I traueilide criynge, my cheekis weren maad hoose; myn iyen failiden, the while Y hope in to my God.
5 Thei that hatiden me with out cause; weren multiplied aboue the heeris of myn heed. Myn enemyes that pursueden me vniustli weren coumfortid; Y paiede thanne tho thingis, whiche Y rauischide not.
6 God, thou knowist myn vnkunnyng; and my trespassis ben not hid fro thee.
7 Lord, Lord of vertues; thei, that abiden thee, be not aschamed in me. God of Israel; thei, that seken thee, be not schent on me.

4 For biholdyng is not to the deth of hem; and stidefastnesse in the sikenesse of hem.
5 Thei ben not in the trauel of men; and thei schulen not be betun with men.
6 Therfore pride helde hem; thei weren hilid with her wickidnesse and vnfeithfulnesse.
7 The wickidnesse of hem cam forth as of fatnesse; thei yeden in to desire of herte.
8 Thei thouyten and spaken weiwardnesse; thei spaken wickidnesse an hiy.
9 Thei puttiden her mouth in to heuene; and her tunge passide in erthe.
10 Therfor my puple schal be conuertid here; and fulle daies schulen be foundun in hem.
11 And thei seiden, How woot God; and whether kunnyng is an heiye, `that is, in heuene?
12 Lo! thilke synneris and hauynge aboundance in the world; helden richessis.
13 And Y seide, Therfor without cause Y iustifiede myn herte; and waischide myn hoondis among innocentis.
14 And Y was betun al dai; and my chastisyng was in morutidis.
15 If Y seide, Y schal telle thus; lo! Y repreuede the nacioun of thi sones.
16 I gesside, that Y schulde knowe this; trauel is bifore me.
17 Til Y entre in to the seyntuarie of God; and vndurstonde in the last thingis of hem.
18 Netheles for gilis thou hast put to hem; thou castidist hem doun, while thei weren reisid.
19 Hou ben thei maad into desolacioun; thei failiden sodeynli, thei perischiden for her wickidnesse.
20 As the dreem of men that risen; Lord, thou schalt dryue her ymage to nouyt in thi citee.
21 For myn herte is enflaumed, and my reynes ben chaungid;
22 and Y am dryuun to nouyt, and Y wiste not.
23 As a werk beeste Y am maad at thee; and Y am euere with thee.
24 Thou heldist my riythond, and in thi wille thou leddist me forth; and with glorie thou tokist me vp.
25 For whi what is to me in heuene; and what wolde Y of thee on erthe?
26 Mi fleische and myn herte failide; God of myn herte, and my part is God withouten ende.
27 For lo! thei that drawen awei fer hem silf fro thee, `bi deedli synne, schulen perische; thou hast lost alle men that doen fornycacioun fro thee.
28 But it is good to me to cleue to God; and to sette myn hope in the Lord God. That Y telle alle thi prechyngis; in the yatis of the douyter of Syon.

PSALM 73

2 Be thou myndeful of thi gadering togidere; which thou haddist in possessioun fro the bigynnyng. Thou ayenbouytist the yerde of thin eritage; the hille of Syon in which thou dwellidist ther ynne.
3 Reise thin hondis in to the prides of hem; hou grete thingis  the enemy dide wickidli in the hooli.
4 And thei that hatiden thee; hadden glorie in the myddis of thi solempnete.
5 Thei settiden her signes, `ethir baneris, signes on the hiyeste, as in the outgoing; and thei knewen not.
6 As in a wode of trees thei heweden doun with axis the yatis therof in to it silf; thei castiden doun it with an ax, and a brood fallinge ax.
7 Thei brenten with fier thi seyntuarie; thei defouliden the tabernacle of thi name in erthe.
8 The kynrede of hem seiden togidere in her herte; Make we alle the feest daies of God to ceesse fro the erthe.
9 We han not seyn oure signes, now `no profete is; and he schal no more knowe vs.

11 Whi turnest thou awei thin hoond, and `to drawe out thi riythond fro the myddis of thi bosum, til in to the ende?
12 Forsothe God oure kyng bifore worldis; wrouyte heelthe in the mydis of erthe.
13 Thou madist sad the see bi thi vertu; thou hast troblid the heedis of dragouns in watris.
14 Thou hast broke the heedis of `the dragoun; thou hast youe hym to mete to the puplis of Ethiopiens.
15 Thou hast broke wellis, and strondis; thou madist drie the flodis of Ethan.
16 The dai is thin, and the niyt is thin; thou madist the moreutid and the sunne.
17 Thou madist alle the endis of erthe; somer and veer tyme, thou fourmedist tho.
18 Be thou myndeful of this thing, the enemye hath seid schenschip to the Lord; and the vnwijs puple hath excitid to ire thi name.
19 Bitake thou not to beestis men knoulechenge to thee; and foryete thou not in to the ende the soulis of thi pore men.
20 Biholde in to thi testament; for thei that ben maad derk of erthe, ben fillid with the housis of wickidnessis.
21 A meke man be not turned awei maad aschamed;  a pore man and nedi schulen herie thi name.
22 God, rise vp, deme thou thi cause; be thou myndeful of thin vpbreidyngis, of tho that ben al dai of the vnwise man.
23 Foryete thou not the voices of thin enemyes; the pride of hem that haten thee, stieth euere.

PSALM 74

3 We schulen telle thi merueilis; whanne Y schal take tyme, Y schal deme riytfulnesses.
4 The erthe is meltid, and alle that duellen ther ynne; Y confermede the pileris therof.
5 I seide to wickid men, Nyle ye do wickidli; and to trespassouris, Nyle ye enhaunce the horn.
6 Nyle ye reise an hiy youre horn; nyle ye speke wickidnesse ayens God.
7 For nether fro the eest, nethir fro the west, nethir fro desert hillis; for God is the iuge.
8 He mekith this man, and enhaunsith hym; for a cuppe of cleene wyn ful of meddling is in the hoond of the Lord.
9 And he bowide of this in to that; netheles the drast therof is not anyntischid; alle synneris of erthe schulen drinke therof.
10 Forsothe Y schal telle in to the world; Y schal synge to God of Jacob.

4 Ther  he brak poweris; bowe, scheeld, swerd, and batel.
5 And thou, God, liytnest wondirfuli fro euerlastynge hillis;
6 alle vnwise men of herte weren troblid. Thei slepten her sleep; and alle men founden no thing of richessis in her hondis.
7 Thei that stieden on horsis; slepten for thi blamyng, thou God of Jacob.
8 Thou art feerful, and who schal ayenstonde thee? fro that tyme thin ire.
9 Fro heuene thou madist doom herd; the erthe tremblide, and restide.
10 Whanne God roos vp in to doom; to make saaf al the mylde men of erthe.
11 For the thouyt of man schal knouleche to thee; and the relifs of thouyt schulen make a feeste dai to thee.
12 Make ye a vow, and yelde ye to youre Lord God; alle that bringen yiftis in the cumpas of it.

PSALM 76
1 The `title of the sixte and seuentithe salm. `To the ouercomere on Yditum, `the salm of Asaph.
2 With my vois Y criede to the Lord; with my vois to God, and he yaf tent to me.
3 In the dai of my tribulacioun Y souyte God with myn hondis; in the nyyt `to fore hym, and Y am not disseyued. Mi soule forsook to be coumfortid;
4 Y was myndeful of God, and Y delitide, and Y was exercisid; and my spirit failide.
5 Myn iyen bifore took wakyngis; Y was disturblid, and Y spak not.
6 I thouyte elde daies; and Y hadde in mynde euerlastinge yeeris.
7 And Y thouyte in the nyyt with myn herte; and Y was exercisid, and Y clensid my spirit.
8 Whether God schal caste awei with outen ende; ether schal he not lei to, that he be more plesid yit?
9 Ethir schal he kitte awei his merci into the ende; fro generacioun  in to generacioun?
10 Ethir schal God foryete to do mercy; ethir schal he withholde his mercies in his ire?
11 And Y seide, Now Y bigan; this is the chaunging of the riythond of `the hiye God.
12 I hadde mynde on the werkis of the Lord; for Y schal haue mynde fro the bigynnyng of thi merueilis.
13 And Y schal thenke in alle thi werkis; and Y schal be occupied in thi fyndyngis.
14 God, thi weie was in the hooli; what God is greet as oure God?
15 thou art God, that doist merueilis. Thou madist thi vertu knowun among puplis;

17 God, watris sien thee, watris sien thee, and dredden; and depthis of watris weren disturblid.
18 The multitude of the soun of watris; cloudis yauen vois.
19 For whi thin arewis passen; the vois of thi thundir was in a wheel. Thi liytnyngis schyneden to the world; the erthe was moued, and tremblid.
20 Thi weie in the see, and thi pathis in many watris; and thi steppis schulen not be knowun.
21 Thou leddist forth thi puple as scheep; in the hond of Moyses and of Aaron.

PSALM 77
1 The `title of the seuene and seuentithe salm. The lernyng of Asaph. Mi puple, perseyue ye my lawe; bowe youre eere in to the wordis of my mouth.
2 I schal opene my mouth in parablis; Y schal speke perfite resouns fro the bigynnyng.
3 Hou grete thingis han we herd, aud we han knowe tho; and oure fadris. telden to vs.
4 Tho ben not hid fro the sones of hem; in anothir generacioun. And thei telden the heriyngis of the Lord, and the vertues of hym; and hise merueilis, whyche he dide.
5 And he reiside witnessyng in Jacob; and he settide lawe in Israel.  Hou grete thingis comaundide he to oure fadris, to make tho knowun to her sones;
6 that another generacioun knowe. Sones, that schulen be born, and schulen rise vp; schulen telle out to her sones.
7 That thei sette her hope in God, and foryete not the werkis of God; and that thei seke hise comaundementis.
8 Lest thei be maad a schrewid generacioun; and terrynge to wraththe, as the fadris of hem. A generacioun that dresside not his herte; and his spirit was not bileued with God.
9 The sones of Effraym, bendinge a bouwe and sendynge arowis; weren turned in the dai of batel.
10 Thei kepten not the testament of God; and thei nolden go in his lawe.
11 And thei foryaten hise benefices; and hise merueils, whiche he schewide to hem.
12 He dide merueils bifore the fadris of hem in the loond of Egipt; in the feeld of Taphneos.
13 He brak the see, and ledde hem thorou; and he ordeynede the watris as in a bouge.
14 And he ledde hem forth in a cloude of the dai; and al niyt in the liytnyng of fier.
15 He brak a stoon in deseert; and he yaf watir to hem as in a myche depthe.
16 And he ledde watir out of the stoon; and he ledde forth watris as floodis.
17 And thei `leiden to yit to do synne ayens hym; thei excitiden hiye God in to ire, in a place with out water.
18 And thei temptiden God in her hertis; that thei axiden meetis to her lyues.
19 And thei spaken yuel of God; thei seiden, Whether God may make redi a bord in desert?
20 For he smoot a stoon, and watris flowiden; and streemys yeden out in aboundaunce. Whether also he may yyue breed; ether make redi a bord to his puple?
21 Therfor the Lord herde, and delaiede; and fier was kindelid in Jacob, and the ire of God stiede on Israel.
22 For thei bileueden not in God; nether hopiden in his heelthe.
23 And he comaundide to the cloudis aboue; and he openyde the yatis of heuene.
24 And  he reynede to hem manna for to eete; and he yaf to hem breed of heuene.
25 Man eet the breed of aungels; he sent to hem meetis in aboundance.
26 He turnede ouere the south wynde fro heuene; and he brouyte in bi his vertu the weste wynde.
27 And he reynede fleischis as dust on hem; and `he reinede volatils fethered, as the grauel of the see.
28 And tho felden doun in the myddis of her castels; aboute the tabernaclis of hem.
29 And thei eeten, and weren fillid greetli, and he brouyte her desire to hem;
30 thei weren not defraudid of her desier. Yit her metis weren in her mouth;
31 and the ire of God stiede on hem. And he killide the fatte men of hem; and he lettide the chosene men of Israel.
32 In alle these thingis thei synneden yit; and bileuede not in the merueils of God.
33 And the daies of hem failiden in vanytee; and the yeeris of hem faileden with haste.
34 Whanne he killide hem, thei souyten hym; and turneden ayen, and eerli thei camen to hym.
35 And thei bithouyten, that God is the helper of hem; and `the hiy God is the ayenbier of hem.
36 And thei loueden hym in her mouth; and with her tunge thei lieden to hym.
37 Forsothe the herte of hem was not riytful with hym; nethir thei weren had feithful in his testament.
38 But he is merciful, and he schal be maad merciful to the synnes of hem; and he schal not destrie hem. And he dide greetli, to turne awei his yre; and he kyndelide not al his ire.
39 And he bithouyte, that thei ben fleische; a spirit goynge, and not turnynge ayen.
40 Hou oft maden thei hym wrooth in desert; thei stireden hym in to ire in a place with out watir.
41 And thei weren turned, and temptiden God; and thei wraththiden the hooli of Israel.
42 Thei bithouyten not on his hond; in the dai in the which he ayen bouyte hem fro the hond of the trobler.
43 As he settide hise  signes in Egipt; and hise grete wondris in the feeld of Taphneos.
44 And he turnede the flodis of hem and the reynes of hem in to blood; that thei schulden not drynke.
45 He sente a fleisch flie in to hem, and it eet hem; and he sente a paddok, and it loste hem.
46 And he yaf the fruytis of hem to rust; and he yaf the trauels of hem to locustis.
47 And he killide the vynes of hem bi hail; and the moore trees of hem bi a frost.
48 And he bitook the beestis of hem to hail; and the possessioun of hem to fier.
49 He sente in to hem the ire of his indignacioun; indignacioun, and ire, and tribulacioun, sendingis in bi iuel aungels.
50 He made weie to the path of his ire, and he sparide not fro the deth of her lyues; and he closide togidere in deth the beestis of hem.
51 And he smoot al the first gendrid thing in the lond of Egipt; the first fruytis of alle the trauel of hem in the tabernaclis of Cham.
52 And he took awei his puple as scheep; and he ledde hem forth as a flok in desert.
53 And he ledde hem forth in hope, and thei dredden not; and the see hilide the enemyes of hem.
54 And he brouyte hem in to the hil of his halewyng; in to the hil which his riythond gat. And he castide out hethene men fro the face of hem; and bi lot he departide to hem the lond in a cord of delyng.
55 And he made the lynagis of Israel to dwelle in the tabernaclis of hem.
56 And thei temptiden, and wraththiden heiy God; and thei kepten not hise witnessyngis.
57 And thei turneden awei hem silf, and thei kepten not couenaunt; as her fadris weren turned in to a schrewid bouwe.
58 Thei stiriden him in to ire in her litle hillis; and thei terriden hym to indignacioun of her grauen ymagis.
59 God herde, and forsook; and brouyte to nouyt Israel greetli.
60 And he puttide awei the tabernacle of Sylo; his tabernacle where he dwellide among men.
61 And he bitook the  vertu of hem in to caitiftee; and the fairnesse of hem in to the hondis of the enemye.
62 And he closide togidere his puple in swerd; and he dispiside his erytage.
63 Fier eet the yonge men of hem; and the virgyns of hem weren not biweilid.
64 The prestis of hem fellen doun bi swerd; and the widewis of hem weren not biwept.
65 And the Lord was reisid, as slepynge; as miyti greetli fillid of wiyn.
66 And he smoot hise enemyes on the hynderere partis; he yaf to hem euerlastyng schenschipe.
67 And he puttide awei the tabernacle of Joseph; and he chees not the lynage of Effraym.
68 But he chees the lynage of Juda; he chees the hil of Syon, which he louede.
69 And he as an vnicorn bildide his hooli place; in the lond, which he foundide in to worldis.
70 And he chees Dauid his seruaunt, and took hym vp fro the flockis of scheep; he took hym fro bihynde scheep with lambren.
71 To feed Jacob his seruaunt; and Israel his eritage.
72 And he fedde hem in the innocens of his herte; and he ledde hem forth in the vndurstondyngis of his hondis.

4 God of vertues, turne thou vs; and schewe thi face, and we schulen be saaf.
5 Lord God of vertues; hou longe schalt thou be wrooth on the preier of thi seruaunt?

7 Thou hast set vs in to ayenseiyng to oure neiyboris; and oure enemyes han scornyde vs.
8 God of vertues, turne thou vs; and  schewe thi face, and we schulen be saaf.
9 Thou translatidist a vyne fro Egipt; thou castidist out hethene men, and plauntidist it.
10 Thou were leeder of the weie in the siyt therof; and thou plauntidist the rootis therof, and it fillide the lond.
11 The schadewe therof hilide hillis; and the braunchis therof filliden the cedris of God.

4 Blowe ye with a trumpe in Neomenye; in the noble dai of youre solempnite.

6 He settide that witnessing in Joseph; whanne he yede out of the lond of Egipt, he herde a langage, which he knew not.
7 He turnede a wei his bak fro  birthens; hise hondis serueden in a coffyn.
8 In tribulacioun thou inwardli clepidist me, and Y delyuerede thee; Y herde thee in the hid place of tempest, Y preuede thee at the water of ayenseiyng.
9 My puple, here thou, and Y schal be witnesse ayens thee;
10 Israel, if thou herist me, a fresche God schal not be in thee, and thou schalt not worschipe an alien god.
11 For Y am thi Lord God, that ladde thee out of the lond of Egipt; make large thi mouth, and Y schal fille it.
12 And my puple herde not my vois; and Israel yaue not tente to me.
13 And Y lefte hem aftir the desiris of her herte; thei schulen go in her fyndyngis.
14 If my puple hadde herde me; if Israel hadde go in my weies.
15 For nouyt in hap Y hadde maad low her enemyes; and Y hadde send myn hond on men doynge tribulacioun to hem.
16 The enemyes of the Lord lieden to hym; and her tyme schal be in to worldis.
17 And he fedde hem of the fatnesse of whete; and he fillide hem with hony of the stoon.

9 For Assur cometh with hem; thei ben maad in to help to the sones of Loth.
10 Make thou to hem as to Madian, and Sisara; as to Jabyn in the stronde of Sison.
11 Thei perischiden in Endor; thei weren maad as a toord of erthe.
12 Putte thou the prynces of hem as Oreb and Zeb; and Zebee and Salmana. Alle the princis of hem, that seiden;

8 Thi strong veniaunce is confermed on me; and thou hast brouyt in alle thi wawis on me.
9 Thou hast maad fer fro me my knowun; thei han set me abhomynacioun to hem silf. I am takun, and Y yede not out;

4 I disposide a testament to my chosun men; Y swoor to Dauid, my seruaunt,
5 Til in to with outen ende I schal make redi thi seed. And Y schal bilde thi seete; in generacioun, and in to generacioun.
6 Lord, heuenes schulen knouleche thi merueilis; and thi treuthe in the chirche of seyntis.
7 For who in the cloudis schal be maad euene to the Lord; schal be lijk God among the sones of God?
8 God, which is glorified in the counsel of seyntis; is greet, and dreedful ouere alle that ben in his cumpas.
9 Lord God of vertues, who is lijk thee? Lord, thou art miyti, and thi treuthe is in thi cumpas.
10 Thou art Lord of the power of the see; forsothe thou aswagist the stiryng of the wawis therof.
11 Thou madist lowe the proude, as woundid; in the arm of thi vertu thou hast scaterid thin enemyes.
12 Heuenes ben thin, and erthe is thin; thou hast foundid the world, and the fulnesse therof;
13 thou madist of nouyt the north and the see. Thabor and Hermon schulen make ful out ioye in thi name;
14 thin arm with power. Thin hond be maad stidefast, and thi riythond be enhaunsid;
15 riytfulnesse and doom is the makyng redy of thi seete. Merci and treuthe schulen go bifore thi face;
16 blessid is the puple that kan hertli song. Lord, thei schulen go in the liyt of thi cheer;
17 and in thi name thei schulen make ful out ioye al dai; and thei schulen be enhaunsid in thi riytfulnesse.
18 For thou art the glorie of the vertu of hem; and in thi good plesaunce  oure horn schal be enhaunsid.
19 For oure takyng vp is of the Lord; and of the hooli of Israel oure kyng.
20 Thanne thou spakist in reuelacioun to thi seyntis, and seidist, Y haue set help in the myyti; and Y haue enhaunsid the chosun man of my puple.
21 I foond Dauid, my seruaunt; Y anoyntide hym with myn hooli oile.
22 For myn hond schal helpe him; and myn arm schal conferme hym.
23 The enemye schal no thing profite in him; and the sone of wickidnesse schal not `ley to, for to anoye him.
24 And Y schal sle hise enemyes fro his face; and Y schal turne in to fliyt hem that haten hym.
25 And my treuthe and mercy schal be with him; and his horn schal be enhaunsid in my name.
26 And Y schal sette his hond in the see; and his riyt hoond in flodis.
27 He schal inwardli clepe me, Thou art my fadir; my God, and the vptaker of myn heelthe.
28 And Y schal sette him the firste gendrid sone; hiyer than the kyngis of erthe.
29 With outen ende Y schal kepe my merci to hym; and my testament feithful to him.
30 And Y schal sette his seed in to the world of world; and his trone as the daies of heuene.
31 Forsothe if hise sones forsaken my lawe; and goen not in my domes.
32 If thei maken vnhooli my riytfulnessis; and kepen not my comaundementis.
33 I schal visite in a yerde the wickidnessis of hem; and in betyngis the synnes of hem.
34 But Y schal not scatere my mercy fro hym; and in my treuthe Y schal not anoye hym.
35 Nethir Y schal make vnhooli my testament; and Y schal not make voide tho thingis that comen forth of my lippis.
36 Onys Y swoor in myn hooli;
37 Y schal not lie to Dauid, his seed schal dwelle with outen ende.
38 And his trone as sunne in my siyt, and as a perfit mone with outen ende; and a feithful witnesse in heuene.
39 But thou hast put awei, and hast dispisid; and hast dilaied thi crist.
40 Thou hast turned awei the testament of thi seruaunt; thou madist  vnhooli his seyntuarie in erthe.
41 Thou distriedist alle the heggis therof; thou hast set the stidefastnesse therof drede.
42 Alle men passynge bi the weie rauyschiden him; he is maad schenschipe to hise neiyboris.
43 Thou hast enhaunsid the riythond of men oppressinge him; thou hast gladid alle hise enemyes.
44 Thou hast turned awei the help of his swerd; and thou helpidist not hym in batel.
45 Thou destriedist him fro clensing; and thou hast hurtlid doun his seete in erthe.
46 Thou hast maad lesse the daies of his time; thou hast bisched him with schenschip.
47 Lord, hou longe turnest thou awei in to the ende; schal thin ire brenne out as fier?
48 Bithenke thou what is my substaunce; for whether thou hast ordeyned veynli alle the sones of men?
49 Who is a man, that schal lyue, and schal not se deth; schal delyuere his soule fro the hond of helle?
50 Lord, where ben thin elde mercies; as thou hast swore to Dauid in thi treuthe?
51 Lord, be thou myndeful of the schenschipe of thi seruauntis, of many hethene men; whiche Y helde togidere in my bosum.
52 Whiche thin enemyes, Lord, diden schenschipfuli; for thei dispisiden the chaungyng of thi crist.
53 Blessid be the Lord with outen ende; be it don, be it don.

9 For alle oure daies han failid; and we han failid in thin ire. Oure yeris schulen bithenke, as an yreyn;

11 Who knew the power of thin ire; and durste noumbre thin ire for thi drede?
12 Make thi riythond so knowun; and make men lerned in herte bi wisdom.
13 Lord, be thou conuertid sumdeel; and be thou able to be preied on thi seruauntis.
14 We weren fillid eerli with thi merci; we maden ful out ioye, and we delitiden in alle oure daies.
15 We weren glad for the daies in whiche thou madist vs meke; for the yeeris in whiche we siyen yuels.
16 Lord, biholde thou into thi seruauntis, and in to thi werkis; and dresse thou the sones of hem.
17 And the schynyng of oure Lord God be on vs; and dresse thou the werkis of oure hondis on vs, and dresse thou the werk of oure hondis.

2 He schal seie to the Lord, Thou art myn vptaker, and my refuit; my God, Y schal hope in him.
3 For he delyuered me fro the snare of hunteris; and fro a scharp word.
4 With hise schuldris he schal make schadowe to thee; and thou schalt haue hope vnder hise fetheris.
5 His treuthe schal cumpasse thee with a scheld; thou schalt not drede of nyytis  drede.
6 Of an arowe fliynge in the dai, of a gobelyn goynge in derknessis; of asailing, and a myddai feend.
7 A thousynde schulen falle doun fro thi side, and ten thousynde fro thi riytside; forsothe it schal not neiye to thee.
8 Netheles thou schalt biholde with thin iyen; and thou schalt se the yelding of synneris.
9 For thou, Lord, art myn hope; thou hast set thin help altherhiyeste.
10 Yuel schal not come to thee; and a scourge schal not neiye to thi tabernacle.
11 For God hath comaundid to hise aungels of thee; that thei kepe thee in alle thi weies.
12 Thei schulen beere thee in the hondis; leste perauenture thou hirte thi foot at a stoon.
13 Thou schalt go on a snake, and a cocatrice; and thou schalt defoule a lioun and a dragoun.
14 For he hopide in me, Y schal delyuere hym; Y schal defende him, for he knew my name.
15 He criede to me, and Y schal here him, Y am with him in tribulacioun; Y schal delyuere him, and Y schal glorifie hym.
16 I schal fille hym with the lengthe of daies; and Y schal schewe myn helthe to him.

5 For thou, Lord, hast delitid me in thi makyng; and Y schal make ful out ioye in the werkis of thin hondis.
6 Lord, thi werkis ben magnefied greetli; thi thouytis ben maad ful depe.
7 An vnwise man schal not knowe; and a fool schal not vndirstonde these thingis.
8 Whanne synneris comen forth, as hey; and alle thei apperen, that worchen wickidnesse.
9 That thei perische in to the world of world;  forsothe thou, Lord, art the hiyest, withouten ende. For lo!

11 And myn horn schal be reisid as an vnicorn; and myn eelde in plenteuouse merci.
12 And myn iye dispiside myn enemyes; and whanne wickid men rysen ayens me, myn eere schal here.
13 A iust man schal floure as a palm tree; he schal be multiplied as a cedre of Liban.
14 Men plauntid in the hous of the Lord; schulen floure in the porchis of the hous of oure God.
15 Yit thei schulen be multiplied in plenteuouse elde; and thei schulen be suffryng wel. That thei telle, that oure Lord God is riytful; and no wickidnesse is in hym.

2 For he made stidefast the world; that schal not be moued.
3 God, thi seete was maad redi fro that tyme; thou art fro the world. Lord, the flodis han reisid; the flodis han reisid her vois. Flodis reisiden her wawis; of the voicis of many watris.
4 The reisyngis of the see ben wondurful; the Lord is wondurful in hiye thingis.

3 Lord, hou longe synneris; hou longe schulen synneris haue glorie?
4 Thei schulen telle out, and schulen speke wickidnesse; alle men schulen speke that worchen vnriytfulnesse.
5 Lord, thei han maad lowe thi puple; and thei han disesid thin eritage.
6 Thei killiden a widowe and a comelyng; and thei han slayn fadirles children and modirles.
7 And thei seiden, The Lord schal not se; and God of Jacob schal not vndurstonde.
8 Ye vnwise men in the puple, vndirstonde; and, ye foolis, lerne sum tyme.
9 Schal not he here, that plauntide the eere; ethere biholdith not he, that made the iye?
10 Schal not he repreue, that chastisith folkis; which techith man kunnyng?

12 Blessid is the man, whom thou, Lord, hast lerned; and hast tauyt him of thi lawe.
13 That thou aswage hym fro yuele daies; til a diche be diggid to the synner.
14 For the Lord schal not putte awei his puple; and he schal not forsake his eritage.
15 Til riytfulnesse be turned in to dom; and who ben niy it, alle that ben of riytful herte.
16 Who schal rise with me ayens mysdoeris; ether who schal stonde with me ayens hem that worchen wickidnesse?
17 No but for the Lord helpide me; almest my soule hadde dwellid in helle.
18 If Y seide, My foot was stirid; Lord, thi merci helpide me.
19 Aftir the multitude of my sorewis in myn herte; thi coumfortis maden glad my soule.
20 Whether the seete of wickidnesse cleueth to thee; that makist trauel in comaundement?
21 Thei schulen take ayens the soule of a iust man; and thei schulen condempne innocent blood.
22 And the Lord was maad to me in to refuyt; and my God was maad in to the help of myn hope.

2 Al erthe, singe ye hertli to God; serue ye the Lord in gladnesse. Entre ye in his siyt; in ful out ioiyng.
3 Wite ye, that the Lord hym silf is God; he made vs, and not we maden vs. His puple, and the scheep of his lesewe,

5 Herye ye his name, for the Lord is swete, his merci is with outen ende; and his treuthe is in generacioun and in to generacioun.

PSALM 100

2 I schal synge, and Y schal vndurstonde in a weie with out wem; whanne thou schalt come to me. I yede perfitli in the innocence of myn herte; in the myddil of myn hous.
3 I settide not forth bifore myn iyen an vniust thing; Y hatide hem that maden trespassyngis.
4 A schrewide herte cleuede not to me; Y knewe not a  wickid man bowynge awei fro me.
5 I pursuede hym; that bacbitide priueli his neiybore. With the proude iye and an herte vnable to be fillid; Y eet not with this.
6 Myn iyen weren to the feithful men of erthe, that thei sitte with me; he that yede in a weie with out wem, mynystride to me.
7 He that doith pride, schal not dwelle in the myddil of myn hous; he that spekith wickid thingis, seruede not in the siyt of myn iyen.
8 In the morutid Y killide alle the synners of erthe; that Y schulde leese fro the citee of the Lord alle men worchynge wickidnesse.

PSALM 101
1 The title of the `hundrid and o salm. The preier of a pore man, whanne he was angwishid, and schedde out his speche bifore the Lord.
2 Lord, here thou my preier; and my crie come to thee.
3 Turne not awei thi face fro me; in what euere dai Y am troblid, bowe doun thin eere to me. In what euere day Y schal inwardli clepe thee; here thou me swiftli.
4 For my daies han failid as smoke; and my boonus han dried vp as critouns.
5 I am smytun as hei, and myn herte dried vp; for Y haue foryete to eete my breed.
6 Of the vois of my weilyng; my boon cleuede to my fleische.
7 I am maad lijk a pellican of wildirnesse; Y am maad as a niyt crowe in an hous.
8 I wakide; and Y am maad as a solitarie sparowe in the roof.
9 Al dai myn enemyes dispisiden me; and thei that preisiden me sworen ayens me.
10 For Y eet aschis as breed; and Y meddlide my drinke with weping.
11 Fro the face of the ire of thin indignacioun; for thou reisinge me hast hurtlid me doun.
12 Mi daies boweden awei as a schadewe; and Y wexede drie as hei.
13 But, Lord, thou dwellist with outen ende; and thi memorial in generacioun and in to generacioun.
14 Lord, thou risinge vp schalt haue merci on Sion; for  the tyme `to haue merci therof cometh, for the tyme cometh.
15 For the stones therof plesiden thi seruauntis; and thei schulen haue merci on the lond therof.
16 And, Lord, hethen men schulen drede thi name; and alle kingis of erthe schulen drede thi glori.
17 For the Lord hath bildid Sion; and he schal be seen in his glorie.
18 He bihelde on the preier of meke men; and he dispiside not the preier of hem.
19 Be these thingis writun in an othere generacioun; and the puple that schal be maad schal preise the Lord.
20 For he bihelde fro his hiye hooli place; the Lord lokide fro heuene in to erthe.
21 For to here the weilingis of feterid men; and for to vnbynde the sones of slayn men.
22 That thei telle in Sion the name of the Lord; and his preising in Jerusalem.
23 In gaderinge togidere puplis in to oon; and kingis, that thei serue the Lord.
24 It answeride to hym in the weie of his vertu; Telle thou to me the fewnesse of my daies.
25 Ayenclepe thou not me in the myddil of my daies; thi yeris ben in generacioun and in to generacioun.
26 Lord, thou foundidist the erthe in the bigynnyng; and heuenes ben the werkis of thin hondis.
27 Tho schulen perische, but thou dwellist perfitli; and alle schulen wexe eelde as a clooth. And thou schalt chaunge hem as an hiling, and tho schulen be chaungid;

2 Mi soule, blesse thou the Lord; and nyle thou foryete alle the yeldyngis  of him.
3 Which doith merci to alle thi wickidnessis; which heelith alle thi sijknessis.
4 Which ayenbieth thi lijf fro deth; which corowneth thee in merci and merciful doyngis.
5 Which fillith thi desijr in goodis; thi yongthe schal be renulid as the yongthe of an egle.
6 The Lord doynge mercies; and doom to alle men suffringe wrong.
7 He made hise weies knowun to Moises; hise willis to the sones of Israel.
8 The Lord is merciful doer, and merciful in wille; longe abidinge, and myche merciful.
9 He schal not be wrooth with outen ende; and he schal not thretne with outen ende.
10 He dide not to vs aftir oure synnes; nether he yeldide to vs aftir oure wickidnessis.
11 For bi the hiynesse of heuene fro erthe; he made strong his merci on men dredynge hym.
12 As myche as the eest is fer fro the west; he made fer oure wickidnessis fro vs.
13 As a fadir hath merci on sones, the Lord hadde merci on men dredynge him;
14 for he knewe oure makyng.
15 He bithouyte that we ben dust, a man is as hey; his dai schal flowre out so as a flour of the feeld.
16 For the spirit schal passe in hym, and schal not abide; and schal no more knowe his place.
17 But the merci of the Lord is fro with out bigynnyng, and til in to with outen ende; on men dredinge hym. And his riytfulnesse is in to the sones of sones;

19 The Lord hath maad redi his seete in heuene; and his rewme schal be lord of alle.
20 Aungels of the Lord, blesse ye the Lord; ye myyti in vertu, doynge his word, to here the vois of hise wordis.
21 Alle vertues of the Lord, blesse ye the Lord; ye mynystris of hym that doen his wille.
22 Alle werkis of the Lord, blesse ye the Lord, in ech place of his lordschipe; my soule, blesse thou the Lord.

PSALM 103
1 The hundrid and thridde salm. Mi soule, blesse thou the Lord; my Lord God, thou art magnyfied greetli. Thou hast clothid knouleching and fairnesse; and thou art clothid with liyt,
2 as with a cloth. And thou stretchist forth heuene as a skyn;
3 and thou hilist with watris the hiyer partis therof. Which settist a cloude thi stiyng; which goest on the fetheris of wyndis.
4 Which makist spiritis thin aungels; and thi mynystris brennynge fier.
5 Which hast foundid the erthe on his stablenesse; it schal not be bowid in to the world of world.
6 The depthe of watris as a cloth is the clothing therof; watris schulen stonde on hillis.
7 Tho schulen fle fro thi blamyng; men schulen be aferd of the vois of thi thundur.
8 Hillis stien vp, and feeldis goen doun; in to the place which thou hast foundid to tho.
9 Thou hast set a terme, which tho schulen not passe; nether tho schulen be turned, for to hile the erthe.
10 And thou sendist out wellis in grete valeis; watris schulen passe bitwix the myddil of hillis.
11 Alle the beestis of the feeld schulen drynke; wielde assis schulen abide in her thirst.
12 Briddis of the eir schulen dwelle on tho; fro the myddis of stoonys thei schulen yyue voices.
13 And thou moistist hillis of her hiyer thingis; the erthe schal be fillid of the fruyt of thi werkis.
14 And thou bringist forth hei to beestis; and eerbe to the seruyce of men. That thou bringe forth breed of the erthe;
15 and that wiyn make glad the herte of men. That he make glad the face with oile; and that breed make stidefast the herte of man.
16 The trees of the feeld schulen be fillid, and the cedris of the Liban, whiche he plauntide;
17 sparewis schulen make nest there. The hous of the gerfaukun is the leeder of tho;
18 hiye  hillis ben refute to hertis; a stoon is refutt to irchouns.
19 He made the moone in to tymes; the sunne knewe his goyng doun.
20 Thou hast set derknessis, and nyyt is maad; alle beestis of the wode schulen go ther ynne.
21 Liouns whelpis rorynge for to rauysche; and to seke of God meete to hem silf.
22 The sunne is risun, and tho ben gaderid togidere; and tho schulen be set in her couchis.
23 A man schal go out to his werk; and to his worching, til to the euentid.
24 Lord, thi werkis ben magnefiede ful myche, thou hast maad alle thingis in wisdom; the erthe is fillid with thi possessioun.
25 This see is greet and large to hondis; there ben crepinge beestis, of which is noon noumbre. Litil beestis with grete;
26 schippis schulen passe there. This dragoun which thou hast formyd; for to scorne hym.
27 Alle thingis abiden of thee; that thou yyue to hem meete in tyme.
28 Whanne thou schalt yyue to hem, thei schulen gadere; whanne thou schalt opene thin hond, alle thingis schulen be fillid with goodnesse.
29 But whanne thou schalt turne awey the face, thei schulen be disturblid; thou schalt take awei the spirit of them, and thei schulen faile; and thei schulen turne ayen in to her dust.
30 Sende out thi spirit, and thei schulen be formed of the newe; and thou schalt renule the face of the erthe.
31 The glorie of the Lord be in to the world; the Lord schal be glad in hise werkis.
32 Which biholdith the erthe, and makith it to tremble; which touchith hillis, and tho smoken.
33 I schal singe to the Lord in my lijf; Y schal seie salm to my God, as longe as Y am.
34 Mi speche be myrie to him; forsothe Y schal delite in the Lord.
35 Synneris faile fro the erthe, and wickid men faile, so that thei be not; my soule, blesse thou the Lord.

4 seke ye the Lord, and be ye confermed; seke ye euere his face.
5 Haue ye mynde on hise merueilis, whiche he dide; on his grete wondris, and domes of his mouth.
6 The seed of Abraham, his seruaunt; the sones of Jacob, his chosun man.
7 He is oure Lord God; hise domes ben in al the erthe.
8 He was myndeful of his testament in to the world; of the word which he comaundide in to a thousynde generaciouns.
9 Which he disposide to Abraham; and of his ooth to Isaac.
10 And he ordeynede it to Jacob in to a comaundement; and to Israel in to euerlastinge testament.
11 And he seide, I shal yiue to thee the lond of Canaan; the cord of youre eritage.
12 Whanne thei weren in a litil noumbre; and the comelingis of hem weren ful fewe.
13 And thei passiden fro folk in to folk; and fro a rewme in to another puple.
14 He lefte not a man to anoye hem; and he chastiside kyngis for hem.
15 Nile ye touche my cristis; and nyle ye do wickidli among my prophetis.
16 And God clepide hungir on erthe; and he wastide al the stidefastnesse of breed.
17 He sente a man bifore hem; Joseph was seeld in to a seruaunt.
18 Thei maden lowe hise feet in stockis, irun passide by his soule; til the word of him cam.
19 The speche of the Lord enflawmede him;
20 the king sente and vnbond hym; the prince of puplis sente and delyuerede him.
21 He ordeynede him the lord of his hous; and  the prince of al his possessioun.
22 That he schulde lerne hise princis as him silf; and that he schulde teche hise elde men prudence.
23 And Israel entride in to Egipt; and Jacob was a comeling in the lond of Cham.
24 And God encreesside his puple greetli; and made hym stidefast on hise enemyes.
25 He turnede the herte of hem, that thei hatiden his puple; and diden gile ayens hise seruauntis.
26 He sent Moises, his seruaunt; thilke Aaron, whom he chees.
27 He puttide in hem the wordis of hise myraclis; and of hise grete wondris in the lond of Cham.
28 He sente derknessis, and made derk; and he made not bitter hise wordis.
29 He turnede the watris of hem in to blood; and he killide the fischis of hem.
30 And the lond of hem yaf paddoks; in the priue places of the kyngis of hem.
31 God seide, and a fleische flie cam; and gnattis in alle the coostis of hem.
32 He settide her reynes hail; fier brennynge in the lond of hem.
33 And he smoot the vynes of hem, and the fige trees of hem; and al to-brak the tree of the coostis of hem.
34 He seide, and a locuste cam; and a bruk of which was noon noumbre.
35 And it eet al the hey in the lond of hem; and it eet al the fruyt of the lond of hem.
36 And he killide ech the firste gendrid thing in the lond of hem; the firste fruitis of alle the trauel of hem.
37 And he ledde out hem with siluer and gold; and noon was sijk in the lynagis of hem.
38 Egipt was glad in the goyng forth of hem; for the drede of hem lai on Egipcians.
39 He spredde abrood a cloude, in to the hiling of hem; and fier, that it schynede to hem bi nyyt.
40 Thei axiden, and a curlew cam; and he fillide hem with the breed of heuene.
41 He brak a stoon, and watris flowiden; floodis yeden forth in the drye place.
42 For he was myndeful of his hooli word; which he hadde to Abraham, his child.
43 And he ledde out his puple in ful  out ioiyng; and hise chosun men in gladnesse.
44 And he yaf to hem the cuntreis of hethen men; and thei hadden in possessioun the trauels of puplis.
45 That thei kepe hise iustifiyngis; and seke his lawe.

PSALM 105
1 The `title of the hundrid and fifthe salm. Alleluya. Kouleche ye to the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy is with outen ende.
2 Who schal speke the powers of the Lord; schal make knowun alle hise preisyngis?
3 Blessid ben thei that kepen dom; and doon riytfulnesse in al tyme.
4 Lord, haue thou mynde on vs in the good plesaunce of thi puple; visite thou vs in thin heelthe.
5 To se in the goodnesse of thi chosun men, to be glad in the gladnes of thi folk; that thou be heried with thin eritage.
6 We han synned with oure fadris; we han do vniustli, we han do wickidnesse.
7 Oure fadris in Egipt vndirstoden not thi merueils; thei weren not myndeful of the multitude of thi merci. And thei stiynge in to the see, in to the reed see, terreden to wraththe;
8 and he sauede hem for his name, that `he schulde make knowun his power.
9 And he departide the reed see, and it was dried; and he lede forth hem in the depthis of watris as in deseert.
10 And he sauede hem fro the hond of hateris; and he ayen bouyte hem fro the hond of the enemye.
11 And the watir hilide men troublynge hem; oon of hem abood not.
12 And thei bileueden to hise wordis; and thei preisiden the heriynge of hym.
13 Thei hadden `soone do, thei foryaten hise werkis; and thei abididen not his councel.
14 And thei coueitiden coueitise in deseert; and temptiden God in a place with out watir.
15 And he yaf to hem the axyng of hem; and he sente fulnesse in to  the soulis of hem.
16 And thei wraththiden Moyses in the castels; Aaron, the hooli of the Lord.
17 The erthe was opened, and swolewid Datan; and hilide on the congregacioun of Abiron.
18 And fier brente an hiye in the synagoge of hem; flawme brente synneris.
19 And thei maden a calf in Oreb; and worschipiden a yotun ymage.
20 And thei chaungiden her glorie; in to the liknesse of a calf etynge hei.
21 Thei foryaten God, that sauede hem, that dide grete werkis in Egipt,
22 merueils in the lond of Cham; feerdful thingis in the reed see.
23 And God seide, that he wolde leese hem; if Moises, his chosun man, hadde not stonde in the brekyng of his siyt. That he schulde turne awei his ire; lest he loste hem.
24 And thei hadden the desirable lond for nouyt, thei bileueden not to his word, and thei grutchiden in her tabernaclis;
25 thei herden not the vois of the Lord.
26 And he reiside his hond on hem; to caste doun hem in desert.
27 And to caste awei her seed in naciouns; and to leese hem in cuntreis.
28 And thei maden sacrifice to Belfagor; and thei eeten the sacrificis of deed beestis.
29 And thei wraththiden God in her fyndyngis; and fallyng was multiplied in hem.
30 And Fynees stood, and pleeside God; and the veniaunce ceesside.
31 And it was arrettid to hym to riytfulnesse; in generacioun and in to generacioun, til in to with outen ende.
32 And thei wraththiden God at the watris of ayenseiyng; and Moises was trauelid for hem, for thei maden bittere his spirit,
33 and he departide in his lippis.
34 Thei losten not hethen men; whiche the Lord seide to hem.
35 And thei weren meddlid among hethene men, and lerneden the werkis of hem,
36 and serueden the grauen ymagis of hem; and it was maad to hem in to sclaundre.
37 And thei offriden her sones; and her douytris to feendis.
38 And thei schedden out innocent blood, the blood of her sones and of her douytris; whiche thei  sacrificiden to the grauun ymagis of Chanaan.
39 And the erthe was slayn in bloodis, and was defoulid in the werkis of hem; and thei diden fornicacioun in her fyndyngis.
40 And the Lord was wrooth bi strong veniaunce ayens his puple; and hadde abhominacioun of his eritage.
41 And he bitook hem in to the hondis of hethene men; and thei that hatiden hem, weren lordis of hem.
42 And her enemyes diden tribulacioun to hem, and thei weren mekid vndir the hondis of enemyes;
43 ofte he delyuerede hem. But thei wraththiden hym in her counsel; and thei weren maad low in her wickidnessis.
44 And he siye, whanne thei weren set in tribulacioun; and he herde the preyer of hem.
45 And he was myndeful of his testament; and it repentide hym bi the multitude of his merci.
46 And he yaf hem in to mercies; in the siyt of alle men, that hadden take hem.
47 Oure Lord God, make thou vs saaf; and gadere togidere vs fro naciouns. That we knouleche to thin hooli name; and haue glorie in thi preisyng.
48 Blessid be the Lord God of Israel fro the world and til in to the world; and al the puple schal seye, Be it don, be it don.

PSALM 106
1 The `title of the hundrid and sixte salm. Alleluya. Knouleche ye to the Lord, for he is good; for his merci is in to the world.
2 Sei thei, that ben ayen bouyt of the Lord; whiche he ayen bouyte fro the hond of the enemye, fro cuntreis he gaderide hem togidere.
3 Fro the risyng of the sunne, and fro the goyng doun; fro the north, and fro the see.
4 Thei erriden in wildirnesse, in a place with out watir; thei founden not weie of the citee of dwellyng place.
5 Thei weren hungri and thirsti; her soule failide in hem.
6 And thei crieden to the  Lord, whanne thei weren set in tribulacioun; and he delyuerede hem fro her nedynesses.
7 And he ledde forth hem in to the riyt weie; that thei schulden go in to the citee of dwelling.
8 The mercies of the Lord knouleche to hym; and hise merueilis knouleche to the sones of men.
9 For he fillide a voide man; and he fillide with goodis an hungry man.
10 God delyuerede men sittynge in derknessis, and in the schadowe of deth; and men prisoned in beggerye and in yrun.
11 For thei maden bitter the spechis of God; and wraththiden the councel of the hiyeste.
12 And the herte of hem was maad meke in trauelis; and thei weren sijk, and noon was that helpide.
13 And thei crieden to the Lord, whanne thei weren set in tribulacioun; and he delyuerede hem from her nedynessis.
14 And he ledde hem out of derknessis, and schadowe of deth; and brak the boondis of hem.
15 The mercies of the Lord knouleche to hym; and hise merueils knouleche to the sones of men.
16 For he al to-brak brasun yatis; and he brak yrun barris.
17 He vptook hem fro the weie of her wickidnesse; for thei weren maad lowe for her vnriytfulnesses.
18 The soule of hem wlatide al mete; and thei neiyeden `til to the yatis of deth.
19 And thei crieden to the Lord, whanne thei weren set in tribulacioun; and he delyuerede hem fro her nedynessis.
20 He sente his word, and heelide hem; and delyuerede hem fro the perischingis of hem.
21 The mercies of the Lord knouleche to hym; and hise merueils to the sones of men.
22 And offre thei the sacrifice of heriyng; and telle thei hise werkis in ful out ioiyng.
23 Thei that gon doun in to the see in schippis; and maken worching in many watris.
24 Thei sien the werkis of the Lord; and hise merueilis in the depthe.
25 He seide, and the spirit of tempest stood; and the wawis therof weren arerid.
26 Thei stien til to heuenes, and goen doun `til to  the depthis; the soule of hem failide in yuelis.
27 Thei weren troblid, and thei weren moued as a drunkun man; and al the wisdom of hem was deuourid.
28 And thei crieden to the Lord, whanne thei weren set in tribulacioun; and he ledde hem out of her nedynessis.
29 And he ordeynede the tempest therof in to a soft wynde; and the wawis therof weren stille.
30 And thei weren glad, for tho weren stille; and he ladde hem forth in to the hauene of her wille.
31 The mercies of the Lord knouleche to hym; and hise merueilis to the sones of men.
32 And enhaunse thei him in the chirche of the puple; and preise thei him in the chaier of eldre men.
33 He hath set floodis in to deseert; and the out goingis of watris in to thirst.
34 He hath set fruytful lond in to saltnesse; for the malice of men dwellyng ther ynne.
35 He hath set deseert in to pondis of watris; and erthe with out watir in to outgoyngis of watris.
36 And he settide there hungri men; and thei maden a citee of dwelling.
37 And thei sowiden feeldis, and plauntiden vynes; and maden fruyt of birthe.
38 And he blesside hem, and thei weren multiplied greetli; and he made not lesse her werk beestis.
39 And thei weren maad fewe; and thei weren trauelid of tribulacioun of yuelis and of sorewis.
40 Strijf was sched out on princes; and he made hem for to erre without the weie, and not in the weie.
41 And he helpide the pore man fro pouert; and settide meynees as a scheep bringynge forth lambren.
42 Riytful men schulen se, and schulen be glad; and al wickidnesse schal stoppe his mouth.
43 Who is wijs, and schal kepe these thingis; and schal vndirstonde the mercies of the Lord?

3 Thei spaken ayens me with a gileful tunge, and thei cumpassiden me with wordis of hatrede; and fouyten ayens me with out cause.
4 For that thing that thei schulden  loue me, thei bacbitiden me; but Y preiede.
5 And thei settiden ayens me yuelis for goodis; and hatrede for my loue.
6 Ordeyne thou a synner on him; and the deuel stonde on his riyt half.
7 Whanne he is demed, go he out condempned; and his preier `be maad in to synne.
8 Hise daies be maad fewe; and another take his bischopriche.
9 Hise sones be maad faderles; and his wijf a widewe.
10 Hise sones tremblinge be born ouer, and begge; and be cast out of her habitaciouns.
11 An vsurere seke al his catel; and aliens rauysche hise trauelis.
12 Noon helpere be to him; nether ony be that haue mercy on hise modirles children.
13 Hise sones be maad in to perisching; the name of him be don awei in oon generacioun.

15 Be thei maad euere ayens the Lord; and the mynde of hem perische fro erthe.
16 For that thing that he thouyte not to do merci,
17 and he pursuede a pore man and beggere; and to slee a man compunct in herte.
18 And he louede cursing, and it schal come to hym; and he nolde blessing, and it schal be maad fer fro him. And he clothide cursing as a cloth, and it entride as water in to hise ynnere thingis; and as oile in hise boonus.
19 Be it maad to him as a cloth, with which he is hilyd; and as a girdil, with which he is euere gird.
20 This is the werk of hem that bacbiten me anentis the Lord; and that speke yuels ayens my lijf.
21 And thou, Lord, Lord, do with me for thi name; for thi merci is swete.
22 Delyuere thou me, for Y am nedi and pore; and myn herte is disturblid with ynne me.
23 I am takun awei as a schadowe, whanne it bowith awei; and Y am schakun awei as locustis.
24 Mi knees ben maad feble of fasting; and my fleische was chaungid for oile.
25 And Y am maad schenschipe  to hem; thei sien me, and moueden her heedis.
26 Mi Lord God, helpe thou me; make thou me saaf bi thi merci.
27 And thei schulen wite, that this is thin hond; and thou, Lord, hast do it.
28 Thei schulen curse, and thou schalt blesse, thei that risen ayens me, be schent; but thi seruaunt schal be glad.
29 Thei that bacbiten me, be clothid with schame; and be thei hilid with her schenschipe as with a double cloth.
30 I schal knouleche to the Lord greetli with my mouth; and Y schal herie hym in the myddil of many men.
31 Which stood nyy on the riyt half of a pore man; to make saaf my soule fro pursueris.

7 A iust man schal be in euerlastinge mynde; he schal not drede of an yuel heryng. His herte is redi for to hope in the Lord;

9 He spredde abrood, he yaf to pore men; his riytwisnesse dwellith in to the world of world; his horn schal be reisid in glorie.
10 A synner schal se, and schal be wrooth; he schal gnaste with hise teeth, and schal faile; the desijr of synneris schal perische.
